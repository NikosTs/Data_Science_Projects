As the Yelp dataset, which I used for the assignment, is big I will attach a link from my sharepoint
where you can download it:

You should unzip the file to get the dataset.


More specifically you can find the respective datasets used:

- yelp_academic_dataset_business, json file
- reviews_yelp, csv file 

contained in the compressed file:

- Project1_NikosTsoukalelis_dataset, 7z file


You can also find the link in the word file Project dataset link
