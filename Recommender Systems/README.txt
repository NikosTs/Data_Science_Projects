As the Yelp dataset, which I used for the assignment, is big I will attach a link from my sharepoint
where you can download it:

https://auebgr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ntsoukalelis_aueb_gr/ERiCBTqunvRDk8r_rT-jUtUBn_TkoGC578-3PijZNuRiEQ?e=HaAOCd

You should unzip the file to get the dataset.


More specifically you can find the respective datasets used contained in the compressed file:

- Project2_NikosTsoukalelis_dataset, 7z file


You can also find the link in the word file "Project dataset link"
