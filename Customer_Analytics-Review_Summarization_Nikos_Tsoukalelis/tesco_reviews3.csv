Collgate total,13th December 2022,Excellent toothpaste teeth feel so clean and fresh after brushing felt amazing,5 stars
Not good anymore,19th November 2022,Something changed lately in formula in many on colgate toothpasts... I will probably not use any of it anymore because of alergy. Been using for many years.,1 stars
Total SF formula is not as good as previous formula,22nd June 2022,Colgrate Total clean mint was the only toothpaste I used for years. It kept my teeth clean & tarter free. That all changed when the formula changed to use Stannous Flouride (SF). My teeth no longer have that slick clean feeling and I had multiple cavities at my next regular check-up. I will not buy Colgate Total (SF). It is not as good as it used to be and the SF seems to be the only ingredient change. Please bring back the previous Colgate Total formula.,1 stars
Could be greener,29th May 2022,We buy the 4.8 oz tube and see the advertisement to recycle. Recycling composite packaging is tough. Why not reduce waste by increasing the saltine sizes to 8 oz?,3 stars

Personally I've never had any whitening toothpaste make any difference in actual whitening, I think I'd have to use whitening strips or get a professional whitening.

Good mildly whitening toothpaste,2nd September 2021,"The packaging is similar to other Colgate toothpastes, it has a standup flip-top lid and a squeeze tube. The toothpaste itself is white with the typical refreshing minty flavor. I used it with my Colgate Hum electric toothbrush. It does not take much to cover your whole mouth. I have the same problem that I have with most toothpaste in that is foams up so much I end up with foam spilling out of my mouth. I need a pause function on the Hum so I can spit out most of it half way through brushing. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and makes it easy for me to scrape off my tongue. I have not been using it long enough to notice if it is making my teeth any whiter. I am hopeful that at a minimum it will keep them from getting any more stained than they already are. I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone looking for a good complete fluoride toothpaste.",3 stars
Excellent for healthy oral care.,2nd September 2021,Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste has a pleasant taste. It has just the right amount of foam and glides easily onto toothbrush.

And they feel clean every time I use this toothpaste.,5 stars
"So far, so good!",1st September 2021,"I have been using the Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste for about a week now. So far, it seems to work as described (only time will tell with the whitening). It's well packed, comes out of the tube easily, no mess. My only wish is that the minty flavor was a bit stronger. I personally like that fresh breath feel in my mouth-this only last a short time with this toothpaste.",4 stars

I felt confident when using the toothpaste and it lives up to its claims of a full-mouth clean.

I will certainly continue to use and will be happy if it continues to perform as it has so far.",4 stars

A decent performer,11th June 2021,"I usually use a different brand of toothpaste so was interested to see what this one was like. To start with the simple things, the tube itself is good. It has a large cap which is easy to ope. And close. Also unlike some large tubes of toothpaste you can stand this one vertically on the cap to take up less space in your cabinet. So, the product itself. It is a 'thick' toothpaste but this is a good thing. Some toothpaste are too runny and as soon as you put on the brush it is starting to run. With this I found that putting the desired amount on the brush it stayed in place. I then did my usual 30 seconds all round my teeth to give it an even spread. Again, because of the thickness the toothpaste stayed in place until I went back tot hat spot. The taste of the paste is good and fresh and I found it didn't 'drip ' down the brush like some others. The claimed benefits of this paste are very impressive and I have no reason to doubt them. It does keep my mouth fresh for most of the day.",5 stars
Good,11th June 2021,I tied this product when I couldn't get hold of my usual brand. I was really surprised at how fresh and clean my mouth felt when I brushed before bed after an earlier curry. I have since bought another tube and will continue to use this toothpaste.,5 stars

The worst tasting toothpaste ever.,22nd May 2021,"This is literally the WORST tasting toothpaste that I have ever used. The toothpaste has a nice minty flavor that lasts for 2 seconds before the misery begins. All of a sudden, the toothpaste starts to taste like mint sprayed with pesticides. After I was done brushing the first time using it, I almost threw up, I was gagging for at least 5 minutes afterwards. I immediately disposed of the tube and have never used it since. For the love of god Colgate, why did you change the formula?",1 stars
Change in flavor is too much,17th May 2021,I just purchased a new double pack of Colgate Total clean mint paste. The taste is overwhelming and it is a little painful.

Super clean teeth!,11th November 2020,"I have really enjoyed using the Colgate Total original toothpaste. I have used it for 3 days now, morning and night and I could notice a real difference in how clean my teeth felt after the first use. I usually stick to a whitening toothpaste, but Colgate Total does so much more than just whiten. My teeth look super shiny and feel really clean. I can't stop running my tongue over my teeth as they feel plaque free and smooth. My 10 year old daughter has also tried to the Colgate Total toothpaste and has enjoyed using it. My daughter is usually fussy when it comes to toothpaste and finds some of the mint flavours overpowering. However, Colgate Total seem to have it just right. It's a mild mint flavour that isn't too overpowering and still freshens breath. After two minutes of brushing in the morning, my teeth feel clean and breath fresh all day. I will definitely continue to use Colgate Total toothpaste after the trial period! Brilliant toothpaste!",5 stars

Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste,9th November 2020,"I would highly recommend Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling really clean and my breath fresh. It tastes great and unlike other Whitening Toothpastes it isn't over bearing, making brushing time longer. I have been using it for 3days which in my opinion isn't long enough to test the Whitening capabilities. So I will update my review in next 7/10 days.",4 stars

Colgate...family toothpaste,9th November 2020,"The first impression is good. Large family tube and strong mint flavor!

Colgate total whitening toothpaste,9th November 2020,After testing the colgate total whitening toothpaste my thoughts are that overall it is a good toothpaste.

The toothpaste has a very pleasant fresh spearmint taste and after a real good brush you can really feel the difference.",5 stars

New Formula Is Horrible,4th October 2020,"So, so wish you would please go back to your old formula. My teeth no longer feel clean after brushing, and it leaves a horrible taste in your mouth. Why did you change your formula to begin with? You had something great! Why ruin it? Unfortunately, my entire family and I are going to have to change our toothpaste (Colgate) which we have used for many many years. It appears by so many of your reviews that we are not the only dissatisfied consumers. Open your ears to the people who actually use your toothpaste 2X a day, 365 days a year!",1 stars
Works a treat,30th September 2020,"We use this daily in our house and it's effective at cleaning teeth, freshening breath and helping keep our teeth white & bright . Can't say I've noticed my teeth being any whiter than usual but they definitely stayed as white as they've ever been whilst using this toothpaste.",5 stars

quality of this toothpaste went down,30th August 2020,"I am using this toothpase for years but somehow after new toothpaste even after brushing my teeth with recommended time I teeth won't get clean and I never get those ""clean"" feeling the way I use to get before, very very disappointed",1 stars
New flavor super gross,30th August 2020,I've always been a loyal Colgate total user but the new flavor is awful. I think i need to find a new toothpaste.,2 stars
Fresh tasting whitening toothpaste,19th August 2020,"This toothpaste is the best I've used. The pump is a really good idea, just use the amount you need and no waste like in a tube.( I wipe the top of the tube as sometimes it goes alittle stickey). The taste is fresh and minty which also leaves your teeth feeling clean, really clean. Your breath is nice smelling as well. I feel this whitening tube has made mine a shade whiter as well. I would definitely recommend this toothpaste and am going to continue to use it as well.",5 stars
Colgate Total with triclosan is better than new Total SF,16th August 2020,"I have used the original Total with triclosan(brushed once daily, and flossed daily) since 1997. My dental hygienists and dentists always complimented my superb tartar control and gum health, until I started unknowingly using Total SF(without realizing triclosan was stripped) around 1 year ago. My dental hygienist started to question my dental hygiene routines, which have stayed exactly the same since 1997. My dentist also alerted me of stains on my teeth. My first try was to brush twice with Total SF instead of once, but my teeth and gum became sensitive with too frequent usage of stannous fluoride. So my current toothpaste is Crest with sodium fluoride without issue.",2 stars
I like this product,11th August 2020,"My teeth look a little cleaner with using this product; it has managed to reduce some of the coffee stains. Taste is ok, I prefer a peppermint taste usually. I like the dispenser as it takes up less room in the bathroom and looks smarter than a tube.",5 stars
Minty Fresh - really nice,10th August 2020,"A go to product for me, the tube is great and avoids a mess. the paste is refreshing and effective. Quality product and brand - you just know what you are going to get. I would highly recommend, especially for use by kids [who make a mess]!",4 stars
What's wrong with squeezing a tube?,10th August 2020,"As someone who is trying to reduce the use of plastic, I feel that there is too much in this product. On the plus side, I like the minty taste & my teeth felt really clean & there is probably less wastage & mess than a normal tube. I didn't really notice that my teeth were any whiter.",4 stars
The worst tooth paste,9th August 2020,"I have ALWAYS used Colgate Total and now they changed it to ""SF"" which is just disgusting. The taste makes me want to throw up. My husband and my kids cannot stand it. We have tried and tried different Colgate Total ones and they are all SF all the same. It leaves my mouth sore and its unbearable. I would love to have my regular Colgate Total back.",1 stars
Clean fresh and no bad breath,8th August 2020,Easy to use no waste left in the pump like in the squeezable tubes leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean and lasts for ages no complaints from me or my family we all brush twice a day and get amazingly clean results everytime,5 stars
Clean and fresh.,6th August 2020,Colgate is a firm favourite of mine. The pump makes it easier to dispense the toothpaste onto your brush and creates little to no mess. It has a lovely fresh taste and leaves your mouth feeling and looking clean and will hopefully keep the stains away.,5 stars
Makes your teeth feel sparkly clean,5th August 2020,I love pump bottle toothpastes as they seem to last so much longer than normal and keep my bathroom sides cleaner than with a tube. My teeth felt nice and clean after using and looked whiter after a couple of weeks of use. The flavour wasn't too overpowering and left me feeling refreshed for some time afterwards. Would definitely recommend,5 stars
Easy to use,4th August 2020,"Easy to use toothpaste. My family prefer the pump toothpaste as it eliminates a lot of mess from the tubes. This toothpaste was a lovely minty flavour and cleaned my teeth perfectly, plus they look a little whiter",5 stars
Great,4th August 2020,"1st time of using Colgate's toothpaste in a pump as have always used the tubes. It is very convenient as it can sit in the bathroom shelf perfectly for all the family to use. After using this the mouth feels fresh and clean. With regards to the whiting of the teeth only noticed a slight difference, this will continue using it to the real results. Personally found that it was easy to use in a pump version than a tube, hence less wastage.",5 stars
Amazing toothpaste!,4th August 2020,For a whitening toothpaste it isn't overly strong in flavour which I actually prefer. It's a really soft mint taste and I have noticed a small difference in the colour of my teeth! I will continue to use this product as I can't fault it!!,5 stars
Nice change from a standard squeeze tube,4th August 2020,Started using this a week ago and it's worked a treat so far. Quality of the product is what I would come to expect from Colgate. Good fresh taste and the pump provides a cleaner alternative to the standard squeezy tube,4 stars
Fab,4th August 2020,"Having tried out the colgate whitening toothpaste pump bottle I have started to buy it. its easier for the kids to use, which is great. I dont have to scrub toothpaste off the window sill anymore haha. Ive always used colgate and i can recommend it highly, as a dental nurse I recommend this to my patients. Helps to keep your teeth and gums healthy and leave a great smell and taste in your mouth.",5 stars
Pump up the Paste,4th August 2020,"Total toothpaste leaves your mouth fresh and clean and this is what you expect from a Colgate Toothpaste, they have been making toothpaste long enough so how do you improve things? Nice formula that whitens as well as giving you the Total protection. Putting it in a pump container is a great idea too - I don't know why all toothpastes aren't sold like this instead of messy squeezy tubes. Delivers just the right amount, no mess, no fuss.",4 stars
Quite nice!!,3rd August 2020,"I prefer a pump to normal tube toothpaste...no constantly squeezing from the bottom to get some out and then it shooting all over your sink!! It dispenses the right amount. Has the usual minty taste..though I would like to see toothpaste brands do other flavours...a nice lemon one perhaps. It hasn't made my teeth hugely whiter than they are already, but I guess it keeps the stains away so quite happy with that. Overall like it and would definately use again.",4 stars
Great feature to not waste any toothpaste,2nd August 2020,"This toothpaste pump is perfect for those that like to scrunch and squeeze toothpaste and hence when it gets virtually empty, there's a lot of wasted toothpaste that hasn't been used. The pump also allows for more consistent control over how much toothpaste is pumped out as well. No faults on this besides the use of plastic unfortunately.",4 stars
Finally!,31st July 2020,"I was so happy to see Colgate in a pump bottom, as i generally find these much nicer to use than the usual squeezy tube. Nice packaging, better toothpaste! I haven't been using this long enough to see if it whitenings, but the taste and smell are both pleasant and it gives a nice teeth clean.",5 stars
Family favourite,30th July 2020,"Before discovering this toothpaste we were buying 3 different tubes (whitening, sensitive & a normal/standard), however all members of the family have happily used this. The pump idea is great as it regulates how much is used in one go and eliminates squeezing from the middle. Due to the solid base, storage is a lot easier too as it will happily sit on a shelf or in a cupboard and doesn't need propping up. My only reservation is the amount of plastic.",4 stars
Brilliant product.,30th July 2020,Only been using the Colgate total whitening toothpaste for a few days but I can definitely say I like this product. The toothpaste tastes lovely and cleans my teeth and gums really well. I love the pump as it is so much easier to use than squeezing a tube and there is a lot of toothpaste in this tube.,5 stars
So easy to use! And great taste,30th July 2020,I personally love this toothpaste! The taste is great and it froths to the perfect amount so it's not too waterry and falls out of your mouth!! ( haha yes I know rank but sometimes it happens with some ) I also love the packaging it's sooo easy to use just one squeeze and the right amount goes onto your toothbrush! However my boyfriend does think it's less environmentally friendly than other packages,4 stars
Lovely fresh feeling,30th July 2020,This toothpaste has a lovely taste which is long lasting and leaves teeth feeling clean. I can't say my teeth look whiter then before using it but I would use this as my regular toothpaste. I like the no mess packaging and nice that it can stand upright.,4 stars
Nice dispenser,30th July 2020,I bought this as my son has mobility issues and finds regular toothpaste tubes tricky. The pump dispenser was easy for everyone to operate. The toothpaste itself is of a good consistency and taste. It did a good job of cleaning teeth.,4 stars
Great freshness,30th July 2020,"I am a fan for Colgate's Total range, I find that my teeth, gums and mouth do feel fresh (relatively after eating) all day, until I use it again The pump feature is extremely handy to Use and it stands neatly in the corner of my bathroom!",4 stars
Wish they had not changed the formula,30th July 2020,"Hate this product since they changed the formula and added the SF...had used for years, now looking for new toothpaste.",1 stars
Family favorite,29th July 2020,"Colgate has been my family favorite for many years. Have been using Colgate Total Whitening Toothpaste for a long time as it's a brand I trust. It protects and strengthens my teeth, has a great taste giving my mouth fresh breath . Using regularly has kept my teeth white and stain free.",5 stars
love it!,27th July 2020,"I love the idea to make toothpaste in a lovely container, that doses toothpaste every time you use. That's brilliant, no more mess with tubes! It gives you just the right amount of toothpaste you need. I also love the taste, not too much menthol in it, and mouth feels fresh and clean after. This toothpaste has a unique formula that helps remove stains and also fights with bacteria on your cheeks and tongue. I absolutely love it!",5 stars
Great product,26th July 2020,"Great toothpaste! It's definitely our favourite, the whole house loves it, even the little one. It has unique design which makes it so much easier to use and tidy in the bathroom, lovely taste and fresh minty mouth!",5 stars
Great value toothpaste,25th July 2020,Great value toothpaste in a convenient pump which is much cleaner and easier to use than a traditional tube. The toothpaste leaves your mouth and breath feeling fresh for a good amount of time after brushing.,5 stars
A great does it all toothpaste in a mess free pump,24th July 2020,"I love this toothpaste for a number of reasons... 1. It tastes great 2. It doesn't hurt my sensitive teeth 3. It whitens, fights cavities, freshens breath etc. all-in-one.... and (best of all for the kids!) 4. It is mess free due to the pump.",5 stars
5 Stars,24th July 2020,"Colgate, it's one of my favorite products. The bleaching effect of this specific product can be seen after a few days of using it. But what I particularly like about this toothpaste, is the packaging. Having children, the toothpaste is often wasted in the sink, or the tube is not used all, but this type of packaging, is phenomenal, there are no no waste, use it all to the last drop.I absolutely recommend it.",5 stars
Must have!,23rd July 2020,"The great feature of this toothpaste is the pump bottle it comes in. It's a lot cleaner to use, pumping out the correct amount onto your tooth brush! I hate faffing around with small toothpaste lids and sometimes they even get lost. This has changed the game for me! Also it's got a great minty taste and guarantees fresh breath for longer.",5 stars
TOTAL Artificial,23rd July 2020,"The artificial flavoring is WAY too strong! So much so it would leave my mouth burning. After a couple of uses I could not stand it and toss it into the garbage. Such a waste of money!!! ENOUGH with the artificial flavors and ingredients!!! I want a plain, simple toothpaste that doesn't have a list of chemical ingredients !!!",1 stars
Colgate pump,23rd July 2020,Great dispenser easy to use with no mess and waste.nice fresh taste and easy to brush your teeth with this.Makes your teeth look whiter after continuous use.would recommend this as it is a great product,5 stars
Stannous Fluoride,18th July 2020,Colgate Advanced whitening was jam. I never bought anything else but now they changed to this SF formula and I am allergic to Colgate. I am so very sad about it. I loved Colgate.,2 stars
"Long-time user, but new flavor is terrible!",18th July 2020,"I have been using Colgate toothpaste for my entire life, and Colgate Total Whitening for many years. Recently, the flavor of the toothpaste was changed and it's absolutely horrible! It's tolerable while brushing, but then leaves a sour aftertaste. The previous formula was so perfect, it tasted good and left my mouth feeling nice and fresh. This new change is so negative that I may have to search for another brand of toothpaste to achieve that fresh, minty taste. Please, Colgate company, go back to the old original formula!",2 stars
I recommend everyone use colgate total,10th July 2020,"Colgate leaves my breath fresh, clean my tongue, whiten my teeth.",5 stars
Daily Use,3rd July 2020,I have been using this product for years and it is keeping my dentist very happy. It leaves me with a totally fresh and clean feeling as well as leaves my mouth feeling refreshed.,5 stars
"Bring back the old Colgate Total minty freshness, please!!!",1st July 2020,"YUCK!! I have used Colgate Total paste (non SF formula) for so many years because it's taste and breath freshening was most excellent. The new SF formula leaves a bad taste and residue in my mouth. I would love to see the old version available again. For now, I'll be blue and shopping for something new.",1 stars

Colgate whitening toothpaste,26th June 2020,I like colgate toothpaste your mouth feels nice and fresh and clean after using this product but wouldn't say it whitens your teeth much if at all but it's a good price and I like taste of it nice and minty and fresh after using it.,4 stars
Great,25th June 2020,"Only toothpaste i will use,teeth n mouth feel so clean n refreshed after useing",5 stars
Can't stand the taste....,25th June 2020,"I have used Colgate for almost my whole life. I found the Total paste had the best taste and seemed to do a good job keeping cavities and such at bay. However, they recently updated the formula and after using it for a week, I was literally nauseated by the after taste. I am extremely sensitive to sucralose in products, it leaves a cloying foul taste in my mouth that only eating can get rid of (kind of defeats the purpose of brushing...) and a lot of companies are not openly declaring that it is in their products. I know with bottled drinks and candies that I have to be careful to check the ingredients, but I did not think I'd have to do this with toothpaste! Even my mother, who isn't as picky with flavors and such, couldn't use it more than once. I have switched to a different Colgate product but am not happy overall with the company's decision to drastically switch the ingredients in my favorite product.",1 stars
Lost another lifetime customer.,21st June 2020,"""New formula"" causes nausea every time I use it. Of course they hijacked the old logo to trick people into buying this inferior product. Apparently they don't make the old one anymore. I'll never buy any Colgate product of any kind again.",1 stars

Amazing toothpaste,10th June 2020,I really enjoy using Colgate's total original toothpaste. It has a unisex scent and flavour hence it is suitable for everyone. What I lie the most about it is that it cares for the mouth cavity such as gums and mucus membrane as well as the teeth themselves. It provides a lasting freshness and combats plaques. I would highly recommend trying it to my friends and family.,5 stars
minty clean,10th June 2020,"Once I applied a pea size amount on my toothbrush, off I went brushing my teeth, a good amount foam worked up in mouth and was consistent throughout my brushing of my teeth.

Quite strong taste,5th June 2020,I would say the tube is quite generous and lasts for a long time. The only thing is the taste-it's quite mentol and sharp in taste which I'm not used to.,4 stars

"Large, Long-Lasting and Minty Fresh!",4th June 2020,"Initially, prior to using the product, the actual tube in which the toothpaste comes in, is large. There's plenty of toothpaste in the tube, which is beneficial. The overall application of the toothpaste is generous. You don't need a lot of the toothpaste in order for it to do a good job, therefore resulting in the tube lasting a decent amount of time, as other toothpastes require a lot more of the product to be used. It didn't seem to wash off the toothbrush, when put under water, and it also left a nice minty-fresh taste in my mouth, that wasn't too overpowering, but was still noticeable, which was pleasant. I will definitely look into purchasing this product in the future, as it exceeded my expectations of a toothpaste.",4 stars
Great all round toothpaste,4th June 2020,This is a great all round toothpaste. It has a mint flavour which is not overpowering. It foams up nicely and leaves teeth feeling smooth and clean.,5 stars
Perfect all around.,4th June 2020,"I tried Colgate Original toothpaste since few days now and I am really impressed with how it is keeping my mouth feeling fresh and smelling nice.

Thanks for giving me this opportunity to try it out.",5 stars
Classic Colgate,4th June 2020,"Good, all round Tooth paste. Keeps your breath fresh - BUT, my teeth felt sensitive afterwards. Maybe this would change after a week of use (it's only been two days)",4 stars
visible effects within days of use,4th June 2020,This toothpaste shows whitening effects in my teeth within days of using it. The tannin effect from drinking tea that is normally visible at the end of the day is not happening. The flavour isn't particularly strong but the aftertaste does linger for quite a while and your mouth feels fresh and cool after use.,4 stars
Okay as a standard toothpaste,4th June 2020,"It's a nice toothpaste, but had no special qualities I usually look for in a toothpaste (such as being a whitening toothpaste). I also prefer a toothpaste with a cool mint flavour, rather than the original",3 stars

All round freshness!,3rd June 2020,"I'm really impressed with the range of benefits this toothpaste offers - it covers all aspects of oral health and has the bonus of being whitening too! It has a fresh but not overpowering taste and is invigorating to use in the morning. I like the fact that it doesn't foam too much and so isn't messy to use.

Colgate Total original toothpaste,3rd June 2020,"Having tried the Colgate Total toothpaste , I was not completely sure about the effects I was hoping it would have. The flavour was very strong, which was kind of hot on the tongue, I was hoping for better results from the sensitivity side, it did not work for me, which was one of the important factors , unless it needed to be used for a longer period . It did leave a nice feel across my teeth, which did last quiet awhile after brushing. My breath did smell fresh for a good few hours. Unfortunately this toothpaste is not for me.",3 stars

Their new SF formula is horrible!,21st May 2020,"They have ruined this toothpaste with their ""new"" formula. It tastes horrible and leaves a horrible aftertaste in your mouth. It doesn't leave your breath as fresh for as long as the old formula. I'd stay away from this purchase.",1 stars
Changed formula has bad taste and burns.,18th May 2020,I started using the Total brand soon after it entered the market. The last few years I used the whitening variation. The new formula tastes unpleasant to me and gives my mouth a burning sensation. Very unpleasant. I tried gel and paste with the same result. I dislike it so much that I will throw the tubes out. Because the old formula is discontinued I have to find a new brand. How disappointing.,1 stars
I would not buy this product again.,15th May 2020,"I've used Colgate Total Advanced Whitening toothpaste for years. Then Colgate added the Sensitivity ingredient and that changed the way it tasted, and the way it affected the lining of my mouth, and the cleanliness of my teeth.",1 stars

Bad aftertaste with new formula,30th April 2020,"I am a long time user of Colgate Total. Love the minty freshness. I stay away from whitening toothpastes because of increased tooth sensitivity. Now, the ""new"" formula with stannous fluoride is the absolute worst. It leaves the most awful aftertaste that I have ever noted in a toothpaste. After figuring out the reason (and the package labeling) I was able to stock up on several tubes of the old formula. Once those are all gone, I will be in the search for a different brand. Colgate really ruined a good thing.",1 stars
STOP,25th April 2020,Total Advanced Whitening WAS the greatest toothpaste on the market. Colgate decided to save money and changed the formula to STANNOUS floride and ruined its best product. Do your own research - the new formula will turn your teeth a lovely shade of gray or brown! Find another brand! (System would not allow submission with less than one star.),1 stars
Prefer the old brand,11th April 2020,This new taste is awful I prefer the old Colgate Total the white pouch or the blue pouch...I just can't stand the state of this new colgateSF.,1 stars
Terrible!,7th April 2020,"I've used Colgate Total Advanced Whitening for the better part of 6 years. The new SF formulation tastes terrible. At no part in my first experience did i taste anything fresh or minty. It tasted of nasty chemicals and left a nasty residual taste I do not want to repeat. Who in their right mind tested this product before going to market and decided it was a worthy replacement? Bring back the old formulation, and toss this in the circular file.",1 stars
I would not buy it again!,5th April 2020,"I only bought it because Total Fresh Mint was unavailable, the sorbital and sucralose spike my glucose making me feel really bad.",1 stars
Appears good.,A Tesco Customer23rd March 2020,Appears good.,4 stars
Horrible and YELLOW???,19th March 2020,"I thought that this was a counterfeit product. It has a strange texture, an AWFUL taste and the inside of the tube is stained YELLOW. In looking at reviews I realize that this might not be a counterfeit product at all. But I haven't seen anyone else mention the creepy yellow staining on the inside of the tube. Why would Colgate do this? This looks like the end of a 50+ year customer relationship.",1 stars
Not good,13th March 2020,I continued to buy it hoping that it was just a bad batch but it is consistently watery and thinned out. Bad business.,1 stars
Best Toothpaste I've Ever Used.,28th February 2020,"I'm extremely happy that Colgate switched to the new SF formula. Colgate Total SF Clean Mint is the best toothpaste I've ever used. The Stannous Fluoride is incredible. It's far superior to Sodium Fluoride because it does so much more for your teeth and mouth. I can clearly tell that this toothpaste reduces sensitivity, reduces plaque build up, whitens my teeth and leaves my mouth feeling cleaner throughout the day. This is my family's new household toothpaste and it will remain that way as long as Colgate maintains the new formula with SF and also the Hydrated Silica to help with whitening.",5 stars
I will never buy this new formula of Total toothpaste again!,21st February 2020,"This is supposed to be a new formula, but it tastes terrible! Leaves my mouth feeling pasty and dry. I will never buy this again. Wish I could still buy the old formula, as it was the best toothpaste ever!",1 stars
New Formula Flavor is horrible No longer ADA Cert,17th February 2020,"New Formula Flavor is horrible No longer ADA Cert New Formula Flavor is horrible No longer ADA Cert Stannous fluoride, is the new agent, prefer the old formula and by the other reviews, others do as well....HORRIBLE... Been using Colgate total for years, now back to Crest Tarter control...",1 stars
I do not like the NEW FLAVOR - bring back the old!,17th February 2020,"I don't know how this ""new flavor"" passed any comprehensive taste tests. It leaves a strong aftertaste and the ""paste"" is closer to a slurry, that is a bit runny when brushing. Where can I get the old flavor and paste?",2 stars
"""New and improved"" formula is horrible",4th February 2020,"I have used Colgate Total Advanced Whitening for many many years. However, I find the new formula leaves an awful taste in my mouth that leaves me feeling nauseous and is unbearable. I'm disappointed that I am going to have to find a new toothpaste as I loved using the old formula.",1 stars
Allergic to Stannous Flouride,2nd February 2020,"Total was my go-to. Now there's ""sensitivity relief"" in every version, which means stannous flouride. I'm allergic to SF. I discovered this a few years ago when I had a bad reaction to Sensodyne - little ulcers all around my tongue, mouth sores etc. Now Colgate has added it to everything, leaving me with few options outside of switching brands.",1 stars
Bring back old formula.,31st January 2020,Please return to the old formula for Colgate Total and the rest of your toothpastes.,1 stars
The new flavor is awful!,25th January 2020,"I've used Colgate Total Clean Mint for years but no more. The new flavor is just awful, not at all minty and leaves a bad taste. What was the reason for ruining a perfectly good product? Looking for a new brand.",1 stars
New Flavor Leaves Bad Taste,20th January 2020,"The new taste has too much mint and leaves an after taste that lasts for more that an hour. The new formula leaves a weird tingling in my mouth and on my lips. The toothpaste foams too much causing chocking and overflowing from my mouth which then gets on my clothes. I prefer paste over gel but the paste tasted so bad that after just two days I went to the store to purchase the gel. I looked at the box for the ""new flavor"" label and when it was not seen I purchased the product. Not until you open the box do you see on the tube it says ""New Flavor"". I've used Colgate toothpaste since I was in the US Army over 50 years ago and I've used Total for several years. I feel I have no choice but to go to another brand of toothpaste.",1 stars
Disgusting New Flavor,20th January 2020,I used to buy this in bulk because it was the bomb. Now it's horrible. 🤮,1 stars
WHAT DID YOU DO?,13th January 2020,I've used Colgate Total for years. It was an amazing product. The new formula is disgusting. I can't get the taste out of my mouth. Will no longer be recommending this to my patients,1 stars
Considering Crest,13th January 2020,I used to give this product rave reviews. I went to Europe and brought my own toothpaste to make sure I would be happy. I brush 2 times a day my whole life and due to work travel did not go to the dentist for 7 years and use a manual brush (I know a dentist nightmare). When I finally went to the dentist after 7 years I had no cavities so the toothpaste worked really well. But I hate this new formula. My mouth is sensitive from it and the flavor is terrible. I am going to switch to crest since the Colgate's all transitioned to this SF brand. I am honestly so sad because it was a reliable product and I was a user for many years.,1 stars
New Formula is Horrible!,13th January 2020,"I have used Colgate Total for years. It was my favorite toothpaste. However, when it was reformulated, I hate it! It tastes HORRIBLE and leaves a really bad aftertaste. It also causes sores on my tongue. I guess I'll be switching brands!",1 stars
I would not buy this product again,10th January 2020,I am a registered dental hygienist and have recommended Colgate Total over Crest for many years. I felt the triclosan was a great addition to the tpaste and now I am hearing that they have changed the formula. Is this true? If they have substituted SF for triclosan it is not working! I discouraged patients from using Crest Pro Health becasue of the SF and the staining potential. This tpaste irritates my gums and causes dry mouth. I will definitely tell my patients not to use this product.,1 stars
Hate the taste of new formula,9th January 2020,"I have used Colgate total since the dentist I worked for 20 years ago recommended it. But, the new formula leaves a disgusting after taste. I don't even like kissing my husband right after he brushes with it.",2 stars
Awful,5th January 2020,This is absolutely the worst tooth paste I have used. It leaves an unpleasant taste in my mouth and my stomach feels queasy after I use it. I do not care what the benefits supposedly are but they are not worth it. I tried it for a week and I cannot do it anymore. Sadly I bought a package with multiple tubes in it. I will be tossing them all out.,1 stars
I hate this new formula!!!,30th December 2019,I have been using Colgate Total for many years now. It's been the only toothpaste that gave my mouth that fresh sensation. This new SF formula is horrible!!! It leaves a nasty taste in my mouth and even irritated my gums. It also made my food taste funny. I am not very happy with this formula and I am struggling to find a toothpaste that works for me. Can you please tell me how I can find the old formula? Can you send me packages of the old formula? I can NOT be the only person who hates this new toothpaste. So disappointed.....,1 stars
Just ok,28th December 2019,"This toothpaste is ok, I find the flavour to not be very strong which was great for my daughter. But I like it to be a little more minty, it has the right amount of fluoride ppm for the whole family which is really helpful you wouldn't need to buy an alternative for the younger ones.",3 stars

Minty freshness,18th December 2019,"This toothpaste is good, it is mid range of the toothpaste market I would say, nice taste and good cleaning ability. Reasonably priced it makes a good value for money product",4 stars
New flavor Colgate Total is DISGUSTING,16th December 2019,"Former customer of 35 years and a Registered Dental Hygienist. I find the new flavor to be repulsive. If I wanted a toothpaste to taste like Crest, I would buy Crest. Going to have to find a new brand and let all my patients know of the change to Colgate. This is an epic FAIL Colgate.",1 stars
Terrible taste - new formula,16th December 2019,"Since the formula changed to add the sensitivity ingredient, the flavor of the toothpaste is terrible. It leaves a bad aftertaste and teeth and mouth don't feel fresh. A lifelong Colgate user, I had to switch to switch to Crest.",1 stars
Hate the new flavor,16th December 2019,We have used Colgate Total paste for decades. The new SF formulas tastes horrible (like Crest) and the mint flavor is too strong. Now we need to find a new toothpaste. Bring back the old formula PLEASE!!!!!,1 stars

New Flavor,14th December 2019,My family has been using Colgate total clean mint paste for years and we are all in agreement that we hate the new flavor it's awful tasting and your mouth doesn't feel clean after brushing. Bring back the old flavor.,1 stars
New Formula is Awful,14th December 2019,"We have used Colgate Total for years after Crest changed their formula. What happened? Did Colgate hire someone from Crest, because the new flavor tastes like it. It is okay at first and then a few seconds later it tastes terrible and that terrible taste lingers and lingers. Plus the paste gets quite foamy. My husband used the toothpaste for about two weeks before he threw in the towel. I used it once and threw the nearly full tube away. What a waste! Won't be buying Colgate again any time in the near future unless or until this abomination is discontinued.",1 stars
"I am switching brands after this ""New Flavor"" and formula",11th December 2019,"The new formula takes away from the thick ""paste"" of toothpaste; it comes out of the tube with a thinner consistency. There is absolutely no mention on the outside box of the new spearmint flavor. Only the tube states it's a New (disgusting) Flavor.",1 stars
Absolutely awful new taste,10th December 2019,This new flavor you've released is just terrible. It reminds me of Crest and that is NOT a good thing. It also leaves an oily film on my tongue after use. Bring back the original Colgate Total and bury this new flavor somewhere out in the desert. Don't fix what wasn't broken.,1 stars
great toothpaste,10th December 2019,colgate toothpaste really cleans my family's teeth and leaves them feeling great.,5 stars

Sf makes it taste weird.,25th November 2019,"For years I have been buying Colgate total in paste mint. It seems the new Colgate total SF has a weird taste to it, and there is no option to buy Colgate total without the SF. I will not be buying again until the SF is removed.",1 stars

New SF formula is horrible,19th November 2019,"I have been using Colgate for as long as I can remember (Colgate Total Advanced Whitening). I recently had to buy a new tube, thought I got the wrong stuff and bought another. I absolutely hate the new formula. It has an awful taste, and my mouth has not felt clean since I started using it a couple of weeks ago. I never feel like my breath is fresh, even right after brushing. On top of all that, I have never in my life had an issue with sensitive teeth....that is until I started using the new formula. Whatever sensitivity relief added has had the opposite effect. have no option but to look for a different brand. Extremely disappointed at the change and wish you would bring back the original formula which I recommended to everyone I knew who asked what toothpaste I use.",1 stars
60 year customer no longer,18th November 2019,I tried a few Colgate varieties. The new active ingredient irritated my gums. Sixty year Colgate customer now searching for a new brand.,1 stars
Change it back!,18th November 2019,"We are long time users, and Colgate was our favorite toothpaste. Since the change in the formula, with the addition of the sensitivity relief, our whole family can no longer stand the taste of the toothpaste. It leaves your mouth feeling dry, and the worst taste in your mouth. It looks like no one is preferring the new formula, would love to see you switch it back, or offer both to those who may want the sensitivity relief. So disappointed, we cannot find a toothpaste that compared to this before the change. Miss our toothpaste!",1 stars
Noooooooo!,17th November 2019,I've used Colgate Total for more decades than I care to admit....and now have to find a new toothpaste. The new flavor is terrible. The aftertaste is worse. Please go back to the original formula.,1 stars
The new flavor isn't that bad,17th November 2019,"I just started using it, but based on what I've read it does whiten your teeth, and that's all I wanted. I never used Colgate a lot, but personally I didn't hate the ""new"" flavor. At the end of the day it whitens my teeth and makes my breath smell better.",4 stars
One of my favourites,16th November 2019,"Colgate is my favourite toothpaste brand. To entirely honest, I usually purchase the one that's on offer in shop however classic one is the one I like the most. Leaves the teeth as well as breath feeling clean and fresh.",5 stars
I would not buy this unless this product goes back,14th November 2019,"When Colgate added Total, I loved it. But this new formula Total SF is killing me. I have been using Colgate past 50 years, but I have to change to other product. My suggestion is bring the old one back as Total Classic like when Coke made a mistake.",1 stars
Best Colgate toothpaste formula ever!,13th November 2019,"So glad Colgate changed the safer formula of Colgate Total toothpastes! The flavor of this particular toothpaste (Colgate total Advanced whitening) is excellent!! It's the freshest minty-flavored toothpaste I have ever tried. It keeps your breath fresher longer than any, also. Thank you, COLGATE!!",5 stars
Colgate Clean,12th November 2019,"I have tried lots of other branded toothpastes but l have returned to Colgate. This is a vastly superior product, makes my mouth feel clean and fresh for hours. My dentist congratulated me on my oral health and at my age that's like telling me I'm a star! Yes, l will be using Colgate toothpaste and l am going to try the whole range.",5 stars
No,12th November 2019,I can't find any Colgate without sensitivity! I don't need toothpaste for sensitive teeth AND it specifically says not to use more than a month. The new taste is disgusting. You had a product that worked. Not anymore. It leaves a nasty feeling to my mouth.,1 stars

Lost a long time customer,10th November 2019,"I bought a couple of tubes of new formula and had to quit using it after 2 weeks. Not only does it taste bad, but it makes everything I eat taste strange and leaves an aftertaste that won't go away. I'll use Colgate as long as I can find the old formula, but when I can't I'll switch brands.",1 stars
Always going back to Colgate,9th November 2019,We tried definitely all toothpastes ever. We always end back to Colgate cause we find it the best match for our family ! From my baby my toddler and us . The best.,5 stars
Not the same Clean Mint flavor!,8th November 2019,"This formula is NOT the same Clean Mint flavor. I don't know if it's the additive of the anti-sensitivity ingredient or what. It appears almost all your products now contain it. Why assume everyone wants that in a toothpaste? Not only is the taste unfavorable but it foams up in my mouth like I'm a rabid animal, and doesn't feel like it completely rinses off my teeth. My teeth feel mildly gritty even after I floss and finish with mouthwash. Very disappointed. I loved this toothpaste because I cannot use whitening toothpastes and this was one of the few that don't have some kind of bleaching ingredient. Heading to the store tomorrow for a new brand. 😞",1 stars

New Taste is Unbearable,29th October 2019,"I've used Colgate and Colgate Total twice a day, my entire life (32 Years). By far, it has always been the most effective toothpaste that also leaves behind a cool minty flavor that lasts for a while after brushing. Unfortunately the new SF flavor is absolutely disgusting. It also makes the food/drink you consume for the next hour or so taste bad. We bought a few different flavors of Colgate trying to find one that doesn't taste bad but they all leave an awful sour taste now. We'll be trying to find a different brand now and won't be back unless the product changes again.",1 stars

Simply the best!,19th October 2019,Have been using this product off and on for many years. I have tried several other toothpastes but have always come back to Colgate. No other toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling so fresh after use.,5 stars

Gross taste,19th October 2019,I have used Colgate for as long as I can remember. I have told my husband numerous times that I will always use Colgate and no other brands because it cleans and freshens! I recently ran out of the regular tube I use so I went to buy a new tube and boy was I let down for the first time ever! Horrible taste and feeling left after brushing. I made my husband try it thinking it might have been just me but he complained about the same thing. I wasted money on a brand new tube of toothpaste that I will not use again. I had to go out in the morning to buy myself a second new tube. Very very disappointed.,1 stars
Does its job,19th October 2019,"It' s a good product that you can buy at a fair price for the quality offered. I buy it from time to time, if I'm in a rush and I don't find my favorite toothpastes. It's doing its job, but is not one the best I would recommend, even though the brand is so well known. Regular product",4 stars
A great toothpaste,19th October 2019,"This is a great all around toothpaste. Not only does it do what a toothpaste is supposed to do, it also provides sensitivity relief, which is great for people like me with sensitive teeth. While it's not technically a whitening toothpaste, my smile hasn't been this bright in a long time. I love it!",5 stars
Great Product,18th October 2019,"Having used this product for a week now, I was thoroughly impressed with this product. The advanced brightening actually worked its magic within a week itself. I will continue using this product in the future definitely.",5 stars
Pleasantly Suprised!,18th October 2019,For years I've used a baking soda based toothpaste. I think Colgate Total SF Advanced Whitening has made me switch from a decades long staple. I was surprised at how Colgate Total SF Advanced Whitening whitened batter than my baking soda toothpaste and as an added plus it even has a fresher taste and feel. You won't go wrong with Colgate Total SF Advanced Whitening.,5 stars
My teeth felt clean but the whitening was not noticeable,18th October 2019,As a regular toothpaste this was great - minty and fresh. But I didn't notice any whitening at all compared to when I use my regular Crest 3D whitening toothpaste.,4 stars

Horrible flavor,17th October 2019,"Our family has been using Colgate for over 20 years with absolute dedication to the brand. However, I recently bought my favorite Colgate toothpaste and it has a new flavor. The new flavor is horrible. My husband and I both cannot stand it. It makes my tongue and gums feel weird kind of like they've been rinsed with Listerine. It leaves a residue. And my mouth does not feel clean after brushing with Colgate anymore. The only way to tell you've got the new flavor is to open the box. So sad. Going to be switching to another toothpaste.",1 stars
Clean feeling teeth,16th October 2019,"I loved the colgate total clean toothpaste I received as a sample. I am really picky about taste , amount of foaming while brushing, as well as, clean feeling after brushing so I did not have high hopes for this toothpaste. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the taste and feeling of my teeth being cleaned after each use.",5 stars

Not a big fan,16th October 2019,"I was really hoping that this product was going to be awesome. After using the toothpaste for a few weeks, my teeth and mouth just never felt really clean. I had this on my counter for my family to use as well and at least one of them agreed with me.",2 stars
Great toothpaste,16th October 2019,I'm a little picky with toothpaste. Mainly when it comes to the taste and texture of the product. Colgate total advanced whitening passed my test! Not only did it feel and taste good but it has the power to whiten as well. In the time I have used it I have noticed my teeth slowly whiten because of regular use.,5 stars
best tooth paste ever,16th October 2019,i love this tooth paste had a nice taste was very cleaning and helped my teeth feel cleaner,5 stars
Clean but burns,16th October 2019,"I tried this toothpaste a few times and really wanted to like it more than I did. My teeth felt really clean after brushing and are whiter even after just a few uses. However, it's SO minty that I found I couldn't even brush like I normally do for a full two minutes without my mouth being on fire! Tone down the mint and it would be much better.",3 stars
Leaves nasty taste in mouth!,16th October 2019,"We have used Colgate Total fresh mint stripe gel for YEARS and loved it!! Earlier in the year I bought a tube not realizing the formula had changed. My husband and I both had the same response....NASTY!! I looked at the tube to see if I had accidentally picked up the wrong type. It was then I seen the little ""SF"" and realized the formula had been changed. I called Colgate and told them it was disgusting! Whoever responds to these reviews, please don't respond with your usual ""would you like to try another kind for free?"" Um, no I don't. The only kind I liked was the kind I used before ""SF"". I want a response about them bringing that formula BACK so we can purchase!! Why in the world did it get changed?!",1 stars

Colgate total Clean Mint,15th October 2019,Colgate total clean mint toothpaste has become my favorite toothpaste. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and hasa slight pleasant mint taste.

Excelent,15th October 2019,So in love with this product!!,5 stars
Great again!,15th October 2019,"I already submitted a review, but apparently it was not received. I actually really love this toothpaste. I don't use Colgate unless a sample size tube is given to me from my dentist. This Total Advanced Whitening has opened my eyes to Colgate and I would be interested in trying future products by them. I always was told the black lines on toothpaste tubes were bad and never to buy those, so I never bought Colgate. After receiving my Colgate I searched their website and found descriptions about these lines on the tubes and how they are only used for sensors to close off the tubes and they mean nothing bad. Another eye opener. The toothpaste tastes great and leaves my mouth feeling great. I use this daily after drinking my morning coffee and am loving it so far.",5 stars
Great product,15th October 2019,Love the Colgate Total Advanced Whitening toothpaste! It is a great product that feels refreshing after I have just brushed my teeth. I have definitely noticed a difference while using it which has made by teeth whiter! Great product overall!,5 stars

Good quality toothpaste,15th October 2019,"Fantastic Product, light, yet consistent. The mint flavor isn't overpowering and leaves the mouth feeling and smelling fresh. Very satisfied and pleased with this product. I highly recommend it.",5 stars
Bitter Taste,15th October 2019,I was excited to try Total Advanced Whitening by Colgate but I was not impressed at all. My teeth did feel clean but it left a bitter after taste that didn't go away for at least an hour. For this reason I will not be using this in the future.,2 stars
Not yet sold on it.,15th October 2019,Not 100% sold on Colgate Total SF Clean Mint. I like the fact that it includes sensitivity relief. That's definitely a must for me when purchasing toothpaste. The flavor isn't overwhelming. I feel like my whole mouth is being cleansed which is another perk. Unfortunately I have noticed my tongue has been sensitive. Feels as if I burnt myself while eating. If it wasn't for that I would've given it a higher rating.,3 stars
Better than Crest!,15th October 2019,"I've used Crest toothpaste exclusively for years, but I have to say that this Colgate Total Advanced Whitening works a lot better than the Crest whitening toothpaste I had been using before. My teeth had quite a bit of discoloration thanks to dental work, and this toothpaste gave me the best results I've ever seen. You can't even see the marks from the braces on my front teeth anymore! The only criticism I have is that the taste is a bit too strong for my liking, but I'm willing to put up with that for the results.",4 stars
Very good toothpaste!!,15th October 2019,This toothpaste leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and clean. It has been a total 180 from my old toothpaste that I have been using for years. This toothpaste will now be my go to brand.,5 stars

Obsessed with this toothpaste!,15th October 2019,Love the taste. Love it's for sensitive teeth. Love how clean my teeth feel after brushing. I'm obsessed with this toothpaste,5 stars
Colgate Total Advanced Whitening,15th October 2019,Colgate Total Advanced Whitening definitely leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh. I don't think it whitened my teeth as well as the kind I regularly use and I didn't notice any relief from tooth sensitivity Either. #colgatetotaladvancedwhitening #tireditforfree #buzz,3 stars
Good Chocice of toothpaste,15th October 2019,I have been using the Colgate Total Clean Mint toothpaste for about a month and compared with other toothpastes I do like the flavor of mint more. Would I pay more for this probably not I still will get what is on sale but I would pick this up over others if they are the same price.,4 stars
Something fresh and super clean,15th October 2019,"I usually use another famous pasta daily. but not this time))) it so happened that I received a sample for testing. Well, that's excellent! You always show real interest in a new product. After family use, they were very satisfied. moreover, we will choose this product on an ongoing basis)) plus - perfectly cleans, polishes teeth, fresh enough and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. I am satisfied !",5 stars
Feel fresh but no minty as I thought,15th October 2019,It is white creamy texture and I feel like its not up to par for the other Colgate products I used. It's not as minty and doesn't feel fresh after use. It also has a chalky aftertaste,3 stars
Great toothpaste,15th October 2019,Works great,5 stars
Better than Crest Pro Health,15th October 2019,"I have been using Crest Pro Health for a long time now as I thought it was the best toothpaste out there. When I received Colgate Total Advanced Whitening I was impressed with the packaging. I thought it looked very nice and appealing. The first time I used it I noticed the texture was nice, but what really got my way the taste. It has a very pleasant, strong taste that wasn't overpowering. It left my North feeling very fresh. The thing I love about this toothpaste of that fresh feeling lasts all day long! With my old toothpaste but the afternoon I always felt like I needed a breath mint. But I noticed I didn't feel like that when I used the Colgate Total. My breath and mount felt fresh and clean all day long. I didn't notice any whitening on my teeth. That is the only thing that makes me not give this fine stars. I will be purchasing this for my myself and my family in the future.",4 stars
Great for a whole-mouth clean experience,14th October 2019,"There is very little that differentiates toothpastes from each other. This one has a few things that helps it stand out. First and foremost, no bad aftertaste. Your mouth feels really fresh! My breath stayed fresh for much longer, it was great. The gums feel good, and clean. Also plaque is slow to re-appear, so you know that it helps really scrub things off your teeth. The one thing I wonder is about Stannous Flouride, as it says on the back that this type of fluoride can cause teeth staining. Have not noticed a whitening effect yet.",5 stars
Minty Fresh!,14th October 2019,This toothpaste turned out to be quite good! When I first tried it I thought it was nothing special but the more I used it the more I realized that it DID make my teeth noticeably whiter and my breath stayed fresher longer! I also really appreciate the flip-top cap! This will be a future purchase for my partner and I!,5 stars
Fresh and clean!,14th October 2019,Cleans my teeth effectively and through every gap. My teeth always feel refreshed and brand new. The mint flavoring isn't powerful like other toothpaste. It's nice and mild. Love brushing my teeth with this toothpaste knowing I'm preventing cavities,5 stars
Dentist Clean Feeling With Whiter Smile,14th October 2019,"This toothpaste is GREAT! After using it, my mouth feels fresh from the dentist. I can feel every individual tooth and feel confident I am cleaning all parts of my teeth and mouth. A big part of why I love this paste is the taste, which is great and much better than my usual Crest toothpaste. On top of this, as a red wine and coffee drinker, my teeth are as white as ever.",5 stars
Different is good,14th October 2019,"I was recently sent a free sample of Colgate Total SF whitening toothpaste on behalf of Bzzagent and the brand. I had tried Colgate Total in the past and wasn't too fond of it. This formula, however, is much better then I had previously thought. It's very refreshing and it left my mouth feeling clean. The toothpaste didn't have any artificial flavoring taste or any type of sweet aftertaste.",4 stars
So fresh and so clean,14th October 2019,"I absolutely love this paste!!! I've been on a journey to find the perfect toothpaste and my journey is over! My mouth feels cleaner, longer. The taste is also refreshing which in the past, I've compromised in order to get a cleaner smile but no more, I can have it all with Colgate Total Advanced Whitening. I received a tube from Bzzagent for Free in return for my honest feedback.",5 stars
Great toothpaste,13th October 2019,I use Colgate regularly and I really like Total Whole Mouth Health. It's good for preventing cavities and gingivitis and protects my enamel and gums. It also tastes great. I would recommend it.,5 stars
Nothing special but still good,13th October 2019,"Didn't notice anything different or unique about this but I still liked it. Whitening didn't work all that great, was hoping it'd help a little but didn't see any difference.",4 stars
new flavor,13th October 2019,"The new flavor is quite strong. It was actually too strong for me to continue using. My mouth felt clean and fresh, but it's too intense for me.",3 stars

Great white teeth,12th October 2019,I tried Colgate Total Advanced Whitening Toothpaste and I was very impressed on how it work it had whiten my teeth much better than other brands. I impressed on how it work it left my breath smelling great.,5 stars
Great freshness,12th October 2019,Brushing my teeth with this toothpaste has made my mouth and teeth feel cleaner then before. I can say this is the first toothpaste that the freshness in my mouth actually lasts more then an hour. Only thing is it doesn't have the ADA logo on the box.,5 stars
This may be my new favorite go to toothpaste!,12th October 2019,"I started using this product about 3 weeks ago and I love it. It has a great taster that is not overpowering but leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath smelling fresh. My mouth feels fresh longer then with other toothpaste I have used. I also use after my morning coffee and it gets rid of that coffee breath taste too, which I am not a huge coffee fan so that is defiantly a plus! I will continue to use to determine if it is whitening my teeth, as I am not completely sure yet. I will be buying another tube of this product when this one is empty.",5 stars
Who knew toothpaste flavor mattered so much!?!,12th October 2019,"I haven't used this toothpaste very long so I am unsure how well the whitening factor has helped my teeth. The strange thing is that there wasn't a flavor posted, just that it was a new flavor. The flavor was very disappointing. Not to my liking at all. It says it helps with sensitivity and with a new filling, I will continue to use this toothpaste until it is gone. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",4 stars
Awesome product!!,11th October 2019,"This product is awesome. I've used it for about a week, my teeth become whiter , I will definitely buy it in the future.",5 stars

Great toothpaste,11th October 2019,I received a sample of Colgate Total Clean Mint Toothpaste from Bzzagent . I love it . My teeth felt so clean and fresh. The mint flavor is great . Ienjoyed brushing my teeth with Colgate,5 stars
Mediocre toothpaste,11th October 2019,"I had high hopes for this toothpaste, it seemed really promising from the packaging. It didn't have a very good taste and I didn't notice any difference in whitening. My teeth did feel clean afterwards though so i guess that's a plus.",2 stars
Tube of meh,11th October 2019,This toothpaste is eye-wateringly minty. However the scent doesn't last. I have yet to notice any whitening. Overall a product I would not buy unless it was on deep sale and had double-able coupons.,3 stars
Works better than others out there,11th October 2019,"The Colgate Total Advanced Whitening SF was amazing. It worked so much better than any other Whitening toothpaste on the market, even better than other Colgate toothpastes. This is my go to toothpaste from now on.

Amazing results,11th October 2019,I really enjoyed using this toothpaste . it really worked,5 stars
Overall Nice Toothpaste,11th October 2019,I have had pretty sensitive teeth for the past few years and have been using Sensodyne for the last year or so to help with the pain. I was excited to see that Colgate Total now included sensitivity relief. Upon trying my free sample of Colgate Total my first impression was the taste. I like a strong mint flavor but this toothpaste is very mild. Not my favorite. I did like how my teeth felt immediately after that first use though. Nice and clean. My sensitivity stayed under control for the whole 3 weeks I have been using it so I would say it is comparable to the Sensodyne I had been using. My gums actually look better now than when I first started so that is a huge win. Overall I really liked using this toothpaste I just with the mint was a little stronger. I will probably purchase this in the future.,4 stars
Surprisingly awesome for sensitive teeth!,11th October 2019,"I am super impressed with the Colgate Total Whole Mouth Health toothpaste! I have extremely sensitive teeth and it is super frustrating buying toothpaste when my options are so limited. Many of the toothpastes that claim to have ""sensitivity relief"" are a sham, so I had my reservations about this. I'm so glad I was wrong! This actually helped my teeth immensely! The only reason I gave it 4 of 5 stars is that the lid is WAYYYYY too easy for kids toddlers to open. I narrowly avoided disaster when my 2 year old nephew got his hands on this in the bathroom. It would have been a great picture though!",4 stars
Great toothpaste,11th October 2019,Made my teeth feel clean. Wish it would have come with coupons to pass out to family and friends. But I did like the product.,4 stars

I would not buy this again.,10th October 2019,I don't like the new flavor and my teeth don't feel clean. I couldn't tell this was the new flavor from the outside of the box. I couldn't tell it was the new flavor till I opened the box and saw it on the tube. I have bought twice now trying to get the original formula.,1 stars
Satisfying Flavor,9th October 2019,"Colgate Total SF in clean mint was a hit with my kids. Over all, it does what toothpaste does. My kids who are 11 and 10 preferred the flavor of this toothpaste over our regular paste.",4 stars
Pretty Awesome Toothpaste,9th October 2019,"Pretty awesome colgare whitening toothpaste. I have used it for about 2 weeks and can see difference in the color of my teeth, I am a coffee drinker and my teeth stain easily. The taste and texture of the toothpaste is great compared to some other whitening toothpastes, there is no grainny feeling or taste of baking soda, which to me is a huge deal when getting new toothpaste. It also leaves my breath refreshing, definitely recommend it and will most likely be switching to this toothpaste form now on.",5 stars
Leaves your mouth minty fresh,9th October 2019,"I enjoyed using this toothpaste. Truthfully I did not notice any difference or feel it whitened my teeth but I was please with the minty flavor, texture, and clean feeling after brushing. The tube is a convenient shape and stays upright on the counter and does not open when traveling.",4 stars
Toothpaste Colgate,9th October 2019,Tasted good. Teeth looked a felt really clean for a long time. It did help with some sensitivity issues.,4 stars
"Fresh, but Intense",9th October 2019,I have been using Colgate Total Advanced Whitening Toothpaste for almost two weeks now. It cleans very well and my teeth look a little brighter! The down side (for me) is the very intense strong flavor - in the morning my senses/gag reflex are higher and some days the taste was too intense for me. If the flavor of the toothpaste was more mild I would have given the toothpaste a higher rating.,3 stars
New Colgate taste Horrible,9th October 2019,"I have used Colgate Total for as long as I can remember, but now am probably going to switch. The new taste is horrible! The new fluoride added makes my mouth numb and leaves a bad aftertaste when finished brushing. Why would you change something that was so great to use.",1 stars
A good family paste,7th October 2019,"Yep, it's Total. It has literally everything you'd want in a toothpaste, minus mouthwash -- minty, freshening, clean-feeling, protective -- especially if you have sensitive teeth. I didn't notice a change in sensitivity after the few weeks I've used it, though, which I guess could mean it still helps fight sensitivity. The downside (and this is a completely personal experience) is that my lips peel after using this paste for a few days. It's nothing a little lip balm can't help with, but still. It is quite pasty, too. If this came in a gel, I'd probably like it more. Still a pretty good paste, though, and the flavor doesn't kick you in the face. But I'd still recommend avoiding orange juice right after you brush...",3 stars
Not the same,7th October 2019,It's not the same as the one before DONT BUY THIS,1 stars
Great Product,6th October 2019,"It effectively cleans your teeth well, but it always burns my mouth.. but thats just me, some kids tooth paste burn my mouth as well. But all n all it does what it's supposed to.",5 stars
Colgate Total Advance Whitening,6th October 2019,Absolutely love this product! Mouth and teeth felt extremely clean and fresh breath. Love love love,4 stars
Bring Back the Old Formulation,6th October 2019,The new formulation is disgusting! Why would you change something that was so good. Please bring back the old version.,1 stars
Refreshing,5th October 2019,I love this product i have been a colgate user since young but with this specific product from their tooth paste has become my favorite since trying it out my teeth feel cleaner after every use and breath stays fresh longer. Highly recommend it.,5 stars
Not the best but pretty amazing,4th October 2019,"This is a pretty standard whitening toothpaste. Great minty taste and definitely freshens up your breath. Leaves your teeth feeling nice and fresh. Not too harsh, but not too mild either. I've been using for about two weeks and have noticed some whitening, but not anything out of this world. Still a great toothpaste and great value too.",4 stars
This toothpaste has a terrible aftertaste,4th October 2019,Used to love this product. Don't think I would buy it again.,1 stars
Whiter smile,4th October 2019,I normally use a different brand of toothpaste. I didn't care for the taste of this toothpaste at first. After a couple days I got use to it and I don't mind it anymore. I'm an avid coffee drinking and after 2 weeks of using this toothpaste I noticed my teeth becoming whiter! My teeth feel nice and clean after brushing with this. The toothpaste states it provides sensitivity relief but i didn't notice relief when drinking ice water.,4 stars
Please bring back old formula!,4th October 2019,I have used this toothpaste for years and it was the only toothpaste I liked! They changed their formula and I didn't realize it until after I bought it. I had to throw the tube away because it tasted so terrible. Please please switch back to the old formula!,1 stars
Refreshing!,4th October 2019,Talk about refreshing! The clean mint flavor tasted great and left my mouth feeling fresh and clean! A whole mouth clean and it makes my teeth feel squeaky clean! Fabulous toothpaste,5 stars
Leaves teeth feeling clean,4th October 2019,"I think it's a good toothpaste, although I've tried others that leave my breath smelling fresher",4 stars
what happened to the good old Colgate total gel?,4th October 2019,Why did you get rid of the old Colgate total gel? The blue gel not the green. This new sf stuff is total garbage. If you do not bring the old stuff back you have lost a customer of 30 years.,1 stars
The Best!,4th October 2019,"When you think of a toothpaste do you think of the ways it benefits you? If not then you should and this is the toothpaste for you! Not only does it have a great taste but it also bubbles up nicely, easy to get out of the tube but it also provides the best protection to the health of your teeth! This is my unbiased and honest review. I did receive this product free in exchange for my review compliments of Influenster #ad #freesample",5 stars
Does Its Job Perfectly!,4th October 2019,"I really like this toothpaste. After using it, my teeth are left with that squeeky clean feeling and a minty taste.",5 stars
Great sensitivity relief!!,3rd October 2019,"I have really sensitive teeth, especially to cold foods like ice cream. Since using Colgate Total Advanced Whitening SF k have already noticed a big difference. I have less sensitivity, which usually isn't the case when using whitening products. My teeth were noticably white after a couple uses. The only issue I had was the flavor. It wasn't quite the clean crisp mint that I like in my toothpaste. Other than that it's an outstanding product that does what it says!",4 stars
Intense Clean,3rd October 2019,"I have used this toothpaste for a little under a month. Pro: This toothpaste is MINTY. If you are someone who likes to feel that minty fresh feeling after brushing, this is your toothpaste. I've never had such a strong mint flavor in toothpaste. It's just shy of being too minty, but I personally loved it. On top of the clean feeling from the mint, the actual toothpaste cleaning power is fantastic as well! My teeth and gums felt squeaky clean! My only con is the whitening aspect of the toothpaste. In the (almost) month that I have used this toothpaste, I have not seen any change in the color of my teeth. It is a little disappointing, but the straight cleaning power of this toothpaste make it worth it!",4 stars
New flavor is terrible,3rd October 2019,I've used Colgate for years and this new taste formula is awful! It drys out my mouth and leaves a nasty after taste. This will be the last tube I purchase unless we get the old flavor back!,1 stars
love it,3rd October 2019,This is a great toothpaste for sensitve teeth. I have very sensitive teeth and not all toothpaste that say they are for sensitive teeth always work for me. This worked really well for me and I will continue using it.,5 stars
Colgate Total Review,3rd October 2019,Packaging is appealing looks like some of the other top brands. The paste gets very foamy when cleaning your teeth. Same foamy feeling as hydrogen proxide. Teeth felt very clean and refreshed after brushing. I have very sensitive teeth and it did not bother me at all. Did not care for the taste too much felt it could have a little more mint flavor. Really did not feel the mint after brushing.,4 stars
Refreshing but Sensitive Relief Questionable,2nd October 2019,"Like many other whitening toothpaste, I find it doesn't really do anything for my teeth. Whitening strips do whiten my teeth but I have sensitive teeth and the strips increases the sensitivity in my teeth. With this toothpaste claiming that it both whitens and provides sensitivity relief, I thought I'd give it a shot. I usually use another toothpaste for sensitive relief. Using Colgate Total Advanced Whitening for 2 weeks, I noticed some sensitivity in my teeth and also noticed that my teeth were not getting any whiter. I did notice that my breath felt fresher but that wasn't enough to get me to switch toothpaste. Sensitivity relief is more important to me than whitening. It may be that my teeth are not conducive to whitening from whitening toothpaste but if you want a fresher breath, I can say that this toothpaste does provide that.",3 stars
Not impressed,2nd October 2019,To me it's just another toothpaste. It is in fact salty. I have yet to reap the benefits of all that it promises. Only time will tell I suppose. I will finish the tube only because I refuse to waste anything. On the plus side it does clean and it's sudsy.,2 stars
Pretty good,2nd October 2019,This toothpaste is pretty good. The taste of it is not overwhelming. As for the advance whitening I'm not sure if it's better then others. My teeth are already pretty white so hard to tell.,4 stars
Colgate Total Advanced,2nd October 2019,Leaves my teeth feeling clean all day.,4 stars
Clean and fresh,2nd October 2019,"I really thought the Colgate Total Clean Mint toothpaste was great! It made my mouth feel clean and had a good taste, not to overpowering. I will def purchase in the future.",4 stars
No I would not buy this product again,2nd October 2019,I have used the old Colgate Total for as long as I can remember. I can not stand the taste of the new Colgate. I am searching for something I like as much but haven't found it yet but using Crest in the meantime. Please just bring back the old Colgate. Offer both if you want but there seems to be plenty of people that share my opinion that it tastes awful,1 stars
Happy Teeth!,2nd October 2019,"So glad to be using this product, I feel clean and refreshed all day long. Nice formula, not too gritty like the baking soda varieties, but still excellent results without the scrub factor!",5 stars
All-in-One Clean Toothpaste,2nd October 2019,"I tried Colgate Total Clean Mint and love it! It's got the right balance of minty flavor, not too aggressive but enough to leave my breath smelling good. It's also got a nice texture and a good amount of foaming- it didn't hurt my sensitive teeth and still managed to whiten them a little! I would highly recommend!",5 stars
"Strong flavor, but good freshening",2nd October 2019,"I don't love the spicy mint flavor of Colgate toothpastes, and even though the Colgate Advanced Whitening said ""new flavor"", it was no exception. However, the toothpaste did leave my mouth feeling very clean and refreshed after I got used to the strong peppermint taste. I was a little confused by the whitening claim as the active ingredient in the Colgate Total, Stannous Flouride, does not list ""whitening"" as a purpose. In fact, the toothpaste tube mentions that products containing stannous flouride may stain teeth. I noticed no staining, or whitening while using this product, but the conflicting claims were confusing.",3 stars
"Better than expected, much better!",2nd October 2019,"Having used Colgate toothpaste in the past, I thought I knew what I would experience with this toothpaste. A slightly fresh flavor that didn't last very long and ""whitening"" that didn't really whiten. Well this stuff is not the Colgate of old. The flavor is very fresh and minty, and lasts a long time. I estimate my mouth felt fresh until I ate lunch. My wife called it spicy. And I could also see a difference on the whiteness of my teeth as a result of using this toothpaste. This is some great stuff. Will definitely be buying in the future!",5 stars
Toothpaste,2nd October 2019,"Well it definitely made my breath fresh. The flavor was good, not too minty. I didn't see a significant difference in the color after using for a week, twice a day. It was too strong of a flavor for my 5 year old. She said it was spicy lol.",4 stars
Clean? Totally!,2nd October 2019,"I have major teeth issues and this tooth paste not only cleaned and whitened my teeth, but also made my mouth feel fresh for hours after using it. the only downside was i did price it in the store and it seems a little high",4 stars
White teeth,2nd October 2019,Dose a good job helping getting our teeth whiter. Be little careful if you have sensitive,4 stars
good but not groundbreaking,2nd October 2019,"The toothpaste certainly met it's punchline in helping my mouth ""feel"" like it's cleaner. It might have even made a slightly lighter shade with my teeth although I failed in my attempt to do some before/after pictures. I didn't give it 5 stars because it didn't necessarily make my mouth feel any cleaner than other higher end toothpastes on the market. In fact, I would say that another competitor's higher end toothpaste did a better job of whitening - one that was much more evident after a few uses. The cleanliness feel was good though and my mouth had a nice aftertaste. My only complaint is that it leaves that film in your mouth after brushing. I'm not a fan of that film.",4 stars
Colgate Total Surprisingly Fresh,1st October 2019,I don't usually care for the taste or texture of Colgate Total but this new Colgate Total Advanced Whitening had a nice mint flavor and wasn't gritty! I will be happy using it in the future without regret.,4 stars
Colgate total clean mint toothpaste,1st October 2019,I loved the Colgate total clean mint toothpaste...it has a great taste and makes my mouth feel refreshed,5 stars
Terrible New Flavor - Please Go Back to Old Formula,30th September 2019,"My family and I have been using this toothpaste for years and loved it and were frequent buyers of it. But this new formula is terrible and left us all hating it. It has a bad taste that doesn't even taste like mint, leaves a horrible residue that lingers forever in your mouth, and it doesn't have any whitening power. It's extremely disappointing since we've been using this toothpaste for so long and with this new formula, we have to switch to a different brand because it's just so bad..",1 stars
Great taste. Great feeling,30th September 2019,"I've been using Colgate Total Advanced Whitening Toothpaste for about a week now and so far, I'm really happy. The toothpaste tastes good, without being to overwhelming. My teeth feel clean and fresh after brushing. i didn't do a before and after to test the whitening, but my teeth do look whiter to me after just a week. I'm very happy with this product.",5 stars
Terrible Change,29th September 2019,"I made the switch from Crest to Colgate Advanced Whitening several years ago at the recommendation of my dental hygienist. I purchased this new toothpaste in bulk not realizing there were any changes to it as the outside packing had no indication of any changes. It wasn't until I opened a box and went to use it that I noticed any changes, first and foremost the size of the tube - it was smaller than the tubes the I used to get in bulk for the same price. Second was the taste which was terrible during use and the residue and after taste which seemed to last for hours. Unfortunately, this product is now unusable to me (I'm left with 4 unopened tubes that will have to get toss) and I'll making the switch back to Crest.",1 stars
Just like every toothpaste,29th September 2019,Toothpaste works great! Seems to be like any other mint toothpaste I've tried. Nothing special but gets the job done!,5 stars
Cleeeeean,29th September 2019,"I prefer Colgate Total Clean Mint to other similar toothpastes because it leaves me feeling fresh and clean without an overpowering, noxious flavor or burning sensation - I find those things to be common with other commercial brands. Y'all KNOW what I mean. It foams up well but doesn't leave my mouth feeling irritated and weirdly dry afterwards. Also, you know how the smell of some toothpastes even feels like it's burning your nostrils? Not with Colgate - I actually find the smell comforting and kind of invigorating. Colgate all the way.",5 stars
Colgate Total Clean Mint,29th September 2019,"I decided to try out Colgate Total Clean Mint for a few days. A few things I really like about the toothpaste. You really only need a dime size or less to get a good clean. A little bit goes a long way, since it seems to produce extra foam. The clean mint flavor is not very strong so if you have looking for a really fresh breathe smell this is not the toothpaste for you. I tend to go for toothpastes with a twist cap, but I might be a converted to the flip cap since it takes up less place in my medicine cabinet.",4 stars
Ok toothpaste,28th September 2019,"I use whitening toothpaste consistently but have never tried Colgate total whitening. I really liked that it is not only a whitening toothpaste but also works towards cavity control, plaque, fresh breath, tartar and much more. The actual toothpaste is white and texture is normal. The smell is pretty strong and had an almost antiseptic smell to it. While brushing my teeth I noticed it spread along my teeth fine and the taste wasn't that bad. It was right after I rinsed my mouth out that my mouth started burning. The burning didn't last too long and it wasn't super strong and after the burning subsided it left behind a fresh clean feel. Colgate Total Advanced Whitening has a lot of good parts to it but the burning feeling makes me hesitant to recommend to others.",3 stars
Awesome,28th September 2019,This toothpaste has been amazing. It has a great taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean everytime I use it.,5 stars

A burst of freshness,27th September 2019,I really enjoy this toothpaste. It left my mouth feeling and tasting fresh. I had just the right amount of foam and worked great with my electric toothbrush. I did notice my teeth looking whiter than usual I will continue to use to see what the end result will be. I definitely recommend you try this.,5 stars
Shiny,27th September 2019,I've always loved Colgate products. This whitening product tastes great and leaves my breath refreshing. I would definitely buy this product again.,5 stars
Great toothpaste!,27th September 2019,"I love how it has made a different with my mouth sensitivity. It provided sensitive pain relief, which I really love about it. The taste isn't bad in your mouth either. I will highly recommend to my family and friends. This a great toothpaste that doesn't disappoint.",5 stars
Super fresh.,27th September 2019,"My whole family loves this Colgate. The taste is super minty fresh that stays with you longer than most toothpastes,I feel as though it leaves my mouth cleaner and fresher than others as well.",5 stars
Trusted Brand,26th September 2019,"I frequently transition between different toothpaste brands, primarily Colgate, Crest and Sensodyne. Of the three, I typically trust Colgate the most due to long-time brand recognition. This brand has once again pulled through with an excellent product. My mouth feels fresh and clean, and my teeth look a tiny bit whiter compared to when I started a few weeks ago. This product will continue to be a reason why I will still be a Colgate user in the future!",5 stars
It protects against everything!,26th September 2019,"I was amazed when I read the all of the claims listed on this tube of toothpaste. It claims to protect against cavities, plaque, gingivitis, tartar, bad breath, and it relieves sensitives, protects enamel, and whitens teeth. This toothpaste does it all. Do I believe it really does all of these things? It is hard to tell after a week or so of use, but Colgate is a longstanding, trusted brand. A little research shows that these claims come from the active ingredient, stannous fluoride, which is where the SF in the name comes from. This ingredient has been around and has worked for other brands. I haven't had any issues so far. All I can tell is that my teeth feel clean after using this, and they look as good as they did before. The toothpaste also advertised itself as having a ""new flavor"". After trying it out, I really can't say that it tasted new at all. It tasted like the same old bitey mint. To be honest, I really couldn't stand the taste at all. I still used the toothpaste, but this made it less pleasant to me. I also didn't like that the tube didn't have a seal. It still came in a sealed box, but it was a little bit jarring to open the lid and see the paste already coming out. Overall, I like Colgate Total Advanced Whitening. It works well to clean my teeth, and I trust it to protect and whiten my teeth. I'd use it again.",4 stars
Fresh smile,26th September 2019,I have tried other toothpastes but Colgate total has my 5 stars from now on! It works great and leaves your mouth clean fresh and healthy! Who doesn't want their teeth and gums protected for 12 hours I will never use another brand of toothpaste again! Thanks Colgate Total! Highly recommend it. :),5 stars
Foamtastic,25th September 2019,I have never cared much for Colgate but this sample changed my mind. I typically like to find products that are all natural and I'm nit sure this qualified but it is a sample snd I didn't research the ingredient list yet. I will say I enjoy the extra bit of foam this paste provides. My mouth feels clean & fresh after I brush with Colgate total clean mint.,5 stars
Does not help with sensitivity,25th September 2019,"My front teeth are extremely sensitive. I currently use the Colgate for sensitive teeth. When I tried the total clean mint toothpaste, I was excited that there was an ingredient for sensitivity. I was super disappointed though, after using it for 5 days with no relief. I gave up and went with my old toothpaste. The taste of the toothpaste is very plain, so if you don't care for the minty feeling, This toothpaste is for you. As for me, I like the extreme mint taste. So sadly, I will not be buying this product for myself.",2 stars
Great toothpaste,25th September 2019,Leaves my mouth fresh and clean. Not too strong of an aftertaste. I've been using it twice a day for two weeks now and I will purchase.,5 stars

Loving the freshness,25th September 2019,I recently got to give this a try and after using it twice a day for a week I'm in love!! My mouth feels so much cleaner and I have a mint flavor in my mouth that lasts awhile. I always look for a product for sensitive teeth. So this toothpaste works great for that. If you're looking for a new toothpaste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh I would recommend this product.,5 stars
Decent toothpaste,25th September 2019,"It did a good job of cleaning my mouth, but it wasn't as fresh as other toothpastes I've used.",3 stars
Okay but not my preference,25th September 2019,It had good flavor and wasn't too minty like some toothpastes. But it kinda left a weird after taste/texture in my mouth.,3 stars

Clean Mouth,25th September 2019,"This is not the normal brand of toothpaste that I use, but I'm so happy that I have it a try.

Excellent toothpaste,25th September 2019,"I've been using Colgate toothpaste since I was a kid and it's the only one I'll use. Colgate Total Clean Mint Toothpaste is the best by far toothpaste on the market, I think. The benefits for me is It keeps my teeth clean, my breath minty and as long as I brush an floss my teeth it will help with cavities. Also keeps me away from the dentist. Thank You Colgate.",5 stars
Great tasting product with a sparkling smile!,24th September 2019,"I have enjoyed using the Colgate Total Advanced Whitening toothpaste over the last week. It's left my mouth feeling fresh and has done a great job helping me keep it clean throughout the day. It's hard to tell yet how much the advanced whitening part of it is working, but I will hopefully see results from that as I continue to use this product moving forward. Great product, highly recommend.",5 stars
HATE THE NEW FORMULA - GOING TO CREST,24th September 2019,The new formula SUCKS!!! I feel like my teeth are not clean & my mouth doesn't feel fresh lIke before! I'm going to crest now because this new formula is terrible!!! It even taste bad & doesn't even taste minty.,1 stars
"Super clean teeth, but beware of stannous fluoride!",24th September 2019,"What a great toothpaste...that is IF you don't react negatively to stannous fluoride! This toothpaste contains stannous fluoride, as opposed to sodium fluoride. They are both great at keeping teeth strong and healthy, however stannous fluoride is known to cause staining on the teeth. It can effect some people more than others and unfortunately I am one of those people whose teeth turn a yellowish/brown color if I use products containing this type of toothpaste. Bummer! Even though my teeth are clean and healthy, when I use this type of fluoride I end up looking like I smoke three packs of cigarettes a day. The good news is, it doesn't effect everyone this way and I am more of the exception. But it's worth being aware of. What I liked about this toothpaste is that it tastes great and my mouth and teeth felt SO clean after using it! I was very impressed at how smooth my teeth felt and my breath seemed to stay fresh for quite some time after using it. If I could use this toothpaste every day, I definitely would. And I do recommend it to others. It's just too bad that I personally cannot use it frequently, due to the staining (its purely cosmetic, my dentist assured me) that happens on my teeth from the stannous fluoride it contains.",5 stars
Makes your whole mouth feel clean and healthy.,24th September 2019,Colgate Total Advanced Whitening toothpaste makes your mouth feel super clean and healthy. The mint flavor is a bit overpowering and hurts my mouth. The sensitivity and whitening elements do not work as well as expected. I was disappointed with the results of those promises.,4 stars
Awesome toothpaste.,23rd September 2019,"Got the free sample and try it a couple times. Wow, so amazing, love the cool feeling you have with the refreshing taste. When your done your teeth feel so clean and your breathe felt so cool and refreshing. Love how my teeth are whitening and look great. Love smiling and knowing my breath is clean and teeth are whitening.",5 stars
It gets your teeth feeling clean,23rd September 2019,Fist let me start by saying that Kim not a fan of toothpaste and prefer the gel option over paste. However after giving this a try I can definitely say that this one isn't as bad as all of the other brands out there and I would definitely buy this as an option when I go to purchase a replacement.,4 stars

Works surprisingly well with my sensitive teeth!,22nd September 2019,"I was nervous about trying Colgate Total Advanced Whitening because I've been a Sensodyne girl for so long, at the recommendation of my dentist for my sensitive teeth. I needn't have worried. Colgate Total Advanced Whitening has been working just fine. I like how strong the flavor is - rather abrasive, really - because it makes my teeth feel cleaner. I haven't noticed my teeth getting whiter, but maybe?",4 stars
Horrible New Flavor,22nd September 2019,I am a user of this toothpaste for years. Will be able to continue using this brand if the don't change the flavor back.,1 stars
Amazing,21st September 2019,I absolutely love this toothpaste. It lightweight and very refreshing. Cleans very well and takes away stains. After brushing my teeth it leaves my breath fresh.,5 stars
A bit confused,20th September 2019,"The box seems just like any other box of toothpaste and it wouldn't stand out to me on the store shelf. The tube is a bit confusing since the box has no mention of a flavor and the tube states ""new flavor"" but again does not state what the flavor is. When using the toothpaste I couldn't tell you what the flavor is. It is not a mint flavor I recognize and doesn't necessarily have a minty flavor to it. The toothpaste foams up well and does leave my teeth with a squeaky clean feeling. I do feel concerned about the high level of ingredients which have questionable testing on whether or not they are carcinogenic to humans. I wouldn't purchase in the future unless the formulation was made safer and wouldn't recommend to others until packaging was made clearer.",3 stars

Great Toothpaste,19th September 2019,"Colgate Total Clean Mint toothpaste has a refreshing taste and doesn't leave your mouth feeling gritty like some other toothpastes, it also helps to whiten your teeth which is a big plus.",5 stars
Great product for sensitive teeth!,19th September 2019,The clean mint flavor is very refreshing and leaves your mouth feeling super clean. I have been using sensitive toothpaste for awhile now and I have to say this one works great for that. I do have to say you need to give it about 3-4 days before you notice that your teeth are not sensitive any more. My teeth were still sensitive after 2 days of use but by the 4th day my teeth were no longer sensitive to hot and cold. All in all this is a great product which leaves your mouth feeling super clean and sensitive free. I would highly recommend this product.,5 stars
Deep clean but not harsh!,19th September 2019,"I'm picky about my toothpaste, and I generally dislike varieties with anything ""special"" added. However, I really enjoyed this type! It has a nice light foamy feeling but also makes my mouth feel very clean after, which is a fine line to walk. I will for sure buy it in the future.",5 stars

Sensitivity suppression that works,19th September 2019,I found after brushing with Colgate Total Clean Mint that my teeth were exhibiting less sensitivity towards temperatures after just a couple occasions.

I've twice bought the Total paste lately only to find the dreaded (to me) New Flavor tubes inside, though the package box doesn't say so.

What a great product.",5 stars
"Sorry, no good",17th September 2019,"I have used Colgate all of my life and was always satisfied. I have to say though that now, I just feel that toothpaste is toothpaste and taste does matter.

I am disappointed in formula change of Colgate Total,17th September 2019,I have used Colgate all my life and the Colgate Total Clean Mint for as long as it has been around.

SF = :(,15th September 2019,"Even though I live in a P&G town, I have been a loyal user of Colgate for 35 years. I've specifically been using Total for about 10 years. I cannot stand the new SF formula. It leaves residue in my mouth, tastes terrible, makes my mouth feel dehydrated/chalky & doesn't feel refreshing or clean. What's even more frustrating is that I always buy in bulk, and due to the barely noticeable package change, I ended up stocking up on something I won't use :( I am at a loss on what to try next.",1 stars
Colgate Total paste now tastes like a gel. Blech!,13th September 2019,"The ""new flavor"" on the Colgate Total Whitening formulation is something I could have done without. If I didn't know it, because I put the paste on the brush, I would think I was brushing my teeth with a gel, such is combination of sweetness and artificial flavor that comes across. It also has a cloying unpleasant aftertaste. Congratulations Colgate you've found a way to even make a paste taste like a gel.",1 stars

"Stannous flouride ruins teeth, can't use Colgate Total now",12th September 2019,"I was a loyal user of the previous formulation of Colgate Total Clean Mint for at least 15 - 20 years, or however long it was made with sodium flouride and triclosan. This new formula stains my teeth, and every other toothpaste I have tried since the change results in plaque buildup within 2-4 hours. The previous Colgate Total Clean Mint formula kept my teeth clean all day. The other current non-SF Colgate formulations available are too abrasive, i.e., contain mica (a mineral found on/in rocks), or have higher amounts of hydrated silica than before. So, the bottom line is that I can no longer buy ANY Colgate toothpaste, and my oral health is going downhill. To even come close to the quality I had before, I now have a greater burden: I have to brush 4-6 times/day, use more and different mouthwash, and floss mutiple times per day. Eventually, all my enamel will be abraded away. I'm DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED at Colgate's decision to not also continue to offer the Total Clean Mint SODIUM flouride version, even if without triclosan (yes, I know about the FDA ban). NOTE: Both stannous flouride and cetyl p(____?) (Crest products) are known to stain at least some peoples' teeth. I'm sure not going to be able to go to the dentist on a monthly basis for continuing stain removal - both because of cost, and damage to enamel (no reputable dentist would do it either)!!!",1 stars
Why?,12th September 2019,I have used this toothpaste for 15+years and was always satisfied with it. It was the only brand I would use or purchase. I also receive many compliments on my teeth and am frequently asked what kind of toothpaste I use. So I was so disappointed when I purchased it and realized it had been changed. At first i thought i made a mistake and picked the wrong one up at the store. I returned only to find that they were all different. I luckily found a store with some of the old original kind and was able to stock up. I hope that by the time i run out the original will be returned to the shelves.,1 stars
New formula is horrible,11th September 2019,"This used to be my absolute favourite toothpaste, but now with the new formula I cant stand it. No other brand compares to the old formula. I wish that was still available as I very much dislike the new one.",1 stars
Can't stand it!,11th September 2019,I was worried that something was wrong with my health. I had no idea that it would leave a bitter aftertaste that doesn't go away between brushing. I have used Colgate total whitening for years. Was so dissappointed.,1 stars
New Formulation Burns Mouth,10th September 2019,"The new formula burns the inside of my mouth and leave it feeling dehydrated. My husband has had a similar reaction and after years of using Colgate Total exclusively, we will need to find a new brand. I imagine this is a result of the fomulation swith to the active ingredient of stannous fluoride. Unfortunately, I bought five of them while last shopping and will have to dispose of them all as I would not expose my children to this new formulation.",1 stars
Awful,8th September 2019,I sent an email awhile back complaining about the new and approved Total. I was sent coupons to try another toothpaste type but none compare to the old version. What happened to all of that old product that was removed from the stores shelves? Can we find it at discount stores..or not because it contains Triclosan? My teeth haven't felt clean in weeks!,1 stars
"HORRIBLE BAD TASTING, NASTY Toothpaste!!!",8th September 2019,"Tried 2 of the Colgate toothpaste products, the Total Whitening SF (new flavor) was so bad I could only use it twice, it has a really bad flavor. I have now tried the Total SF Fresh Mint Gel and it has a somewhat better flavor, but leaves so much foam in my mouth as I brush that I have almost gagged before I was done with the Oral B timer toothbrush.",1 stars
Disgusting new flavor,6th September 2019,"The new flavor is vile. I've used the traditional Colgate total clean mint for years, but they changed the flavor and it is truly disgusting. It contains artificial sweeteners, which tastes gross and can't possibly help your breath stay fresh. Please bring back the old flavor! I'm disappointed that I have to search for a new toothpaste.",1 stars
IF IT AIN'T BROKE ... DON'T FIX IT!,4th September 2019,"You should have learned the lesson from Coca-Cola! When they change their flavor to ""New Coke"", it was an overwhelming marketing disaster! IF IT AIN'T BRIKE ... DON'T FIX IT! The new flavor is so bad, I checked to make sure that it hadn't passed it's expiration date, or that it hadn't been tampered with in the store. IT'S THAT BAD!!!!!!! After using your product for over 30 years, I now have to find a new toothpaste that doesn't taste like it's contaminated!",1 stars
Change is not always a good thing,4th September 2019,"I am not sure why Colgate sought to make a change in a product that was already excellent, but it is a real shame. My family and I have been long time Colgate toothpaste users, and we are extremely unhappy with the new formula. It has a terrible taste, and aftertaste that lingers long after you brush your teeth. In this review I was forced to rate the product with a star in order to submit my review, but sadly, I do not think the new formula is deserving of a single star. I hope Colgate will consider returning to their previous formula, and heed our consumer feedback.",1 stars
Awful taste,2nd September 2019,"Like the other negative reviewers, after using Colgate for decades I will be switching to probably Crest. I can't get the the new taste out of my mouth no matter how much I rinse. Why ever would you change your product.",1 stars
Hate the new formula.,2nd September 2019,"I only used this toothpaste but with the formula change, I can't stand it. It leaves my mouth with a chemical taste and does not bring the clean feeling of the old formula. Please bring back the old formula.",1 stars
Hate this toothpaste,30th August 2019,Hate the Colgate toothpaste with sensitivity added! Teeth do not feel clean at all. Cannot find a Colgate toothpaste in my area without it. Have been a Colgate only user for over 30 years. Not anymore!,1 stars
New Flavor SUCKS!,28th August 2019,"Are you joking? Is this some kind of practical joke? Why would you take the best toothpaste on the market and change it to this HORRIBLE flavor? No one is going to rush out and by your product because it has a ""new"" flavor. But all the current customers are going to try other brands because this flavor (A) is not what they were expecting when they bought it, and (B) because is is really bad. My wife and I both independently tried it and thought it was horrible before we even realized it was ""new"". Switch back before you ruin a popular product. Do you really want to be the toothpaste equivalent of ""New"" Coke? Good career move Einstein.",1 stars
New taste is absolutely horrible,26th August 2019,"After literally decades of brand loyalty I'm scrabbling to find an alternative. I feel like I've just gargled with sour milk after brushing. It's so awful I've just googled it, and I'm reassured to find I'm not alone in this. I'll add this review in hopes you change back and I can resume using Colgate.",1 stars
Why ruin a good thing?,25th August 2019,"I've been using Colgate Total over 30 years and fell in love on first use. The new formula with stannous flouride is horrible. Flavor, texture, and results are bad. I now have teeth sensitivity which I've never had before and is attributed to this toothpaste. Please bring back original formula without the SF and triclosan. Have a toothpaste option with and without SF. I'm now using a new brand. Fell out of love...",1 stars
Colgate Total sf taste horable.,24th August 2019,This is the worst tasting tooth that I have ever tasted. I have used colgate toothpaste all my life but I will never ever use TOTALsf again,1 stars
Disappointed in new flavor,24th August 2019,I have been a longtime Colgate toothpaste user and noticed a horrible change in taste in the Colgate Advanced SF. I noticed it said new flavor so I checked the ingredients. I discovered the awful taste was due to the addition of sucralose to the product. I avoid any product that has sucralose due to the awful taste and lingering after taste that hangs with you. Needless to say I will no longer be buying this product. I've noticed it in a lot of their mouthwashes too. It's just gross.,1 stars
"Bring back the old flavor, please!",21st August 2019,"I have used Colgate toothpaste for literally decades. The reasons are probably equally split between quality and taste. I loved the fresh minty flavor, but the ""new formula"" tastes like soap and that freshly brushed after effect lasts no time at all. Please either bring back the old flavor or introduce an optional one along the lines of what it used to be. Otherwise, after all these years I'm on the hunt for a new brand, unfortunately.",1 stars
Dislike the new flavor,18th August 2019,"I've been using Colegate total exclusively for my entire adult life. I used a new tube today and immediately noticed it tasted different and it didn't feel as bubbly, and minty. I felt it left a residue, as if toothpaste with baking soda. I didn't like it at all. I then looked at the tube and noticed it had new flavor. I went to the store and bought one that didn't have the new flavor. Unfortunately when I got home and opened the package, it was the new formula. I'm so disappointed. I will either try to find a store that has old stock or I will have to switch to a different brand.",1 stars
Leaves an awful taste in your mouth!!!,18th August 2019,"I have used Colgate for years and loved it...but that all changed with the ""new flavor"" !! It leaves you with a horrible taste in your mouth when you are done brushing and stays with you all day! Sad to say, I'm going to need to change brands due to this...I HATE THE TASTE!! CHANGE IT BACK!!!!!",1 stars
What's wrong?,16th August 2019,"Is anyone else getting puffy, sensitive lips and gums? I started using this toothpaste a week and a half ago and that's when my symptoms started. I've been trying to figure out why drinking coffee or other hot liquids burns so much, and it's always worse after brushing. Stopping this toothpaste today!",1 stars
Major Dislike,15th August 2019,"Colgate has been my favorite brand for decades-loved the clean, fresh and tingly feeling after each brushing. The recent formula change with the addition of an ingredient to help with sensitivity was a bad move. Hope to find another brand to replace my favorite toothpaste.",1 stars
Why change the formula and taste of Clean Mint Paste?,12th August 2019,"The taste is awful. Same price, smaller tube size,",1 stars
Hate the new formula,11th August 2019,I have been exclusively using this toothpaste longer than I can remember. This new formula leaves a disgusting taste in my mouth that makes everything I eat and drink also taste disgusting. Disappointed to be having to find a new brand,1 stars
Going to find a new toothpaste after years and years,11th August 2019,Will never use Colgate again. You switched formulas and it's disgusting!,1 stars
HATE the new taste,11th August 2019,"You have lost a lifelong Colgate user. I refused to use the new formula more than twice.I tossed all my tubes. Switched to Crest. Brilliant marketing move, just like New Coke.",1 stars
New flavor has me looking at competitors,9th August 2019,Old formula had a pleasant wintergreen-like flavor and always had great checkups at my dentist. Used it for years. New flavor is horrible and leaves a burning sensation in my mouth. Please go back to the original formula. I will be looking at competitors' toothpastes to replace this.,1 stars
Horrible newly added flavor,9th August 2019,"It was just another typical day when I had to restock on Colgate Advanced Whiting toothpaste. After the initial first opening and brushing of the toothpaste, it had a bad taste in my mouth, but i didn't think much of it. While looking at the bottle I realize they changed the flavor to ""Total SF"". I gave it another shot for a week, but still couldn't stand the taste while brushing, and the after taste of the new flavor as well. The new Total SF also changed the consistency of the paste, to where its more water down. And it also didn't make my teeth feel clean like the old flavored tooth paste as well (But maybe that's just me trying to find the nuances). After careful consideration, unfortunately it looks like I'll be switching to a new brand of toothpaste. I practically grew up with Colgate Advanced Whiting toothpaste (I'm 21 of age), so it's a shame to see them switch flavors. Please bring the old flavor back, or at least the option to buy the old flavor. Because it looks like I'm not the only one who isn't pleased with the difference.",1 stars
New formula is awful.,8th August 2019,"Unfortunately, I'm here to add another vote against the new formula. I've used Colgate Total Advanced Whitening for years, and I loved it. This new formula tastes disgusting. And yes, I know there are other flavors, but I really liked the advanced whitening and there only seems to be the SF version. Please go back to the old formula or make the new one taste better. Until then, I need to find a new brand of toothpaste.",1 stars
A Toothpaste That Does It All,8th August 2019,The addition of the more expensive and ore effective Stannous Fluoride has up'd the game especially for sensitivity as it does a much better job than the cheaper sodium fluoride and without potassium nitrate which can affect one's taste. For those complaining about chapped lips etc. try rinsing your lips/mouth well with water before towel drying.,5 stars
Never Again,7th August 2019,"Have been using Colgate Total for as long as I can remember. I am now sorry I bought the 5-pack. The new formula tastes awful. The paste is soft and messy, making it necessary to clean the cap every couple of days.",1 stars
Tastes Like Glue,6th August 2019,Yuck! Gag when I use it. Sour after taste lasts for hours. What a terrible business decision by Colgate to switch formulas. Used it for years. Going to switch to Crest.,1 stars
New Formula Burns Your Mouth!,6th August 2019,Four more former Colgate Total users in my house. Lousy new formula that is the result of very poor decision-making. We refuse to even finish unused tubes of the new paste. Yuck! This will cost Colgate big-time!!!,1 stars
I hate the new flavor,3rd August 2019,I have been a loyal user of ColgateTotal for many years. Even stopped accepting the free tube of other brand toothpaste given by my dentist every 6 months because it wasn't Colgate Total. But now...the new formula tastes horrible. What did you do and why did you make it taste so bad. I am so disappointed. I'm now trying to find a different brand that tastes better.,1 stars
How could you? The new SF Total are disgusting!!,3rd August 2019,"Colgate Total has been our one and only toothpaste, probably since it came out. Our experienced dental hygienist has always promoted it as the best for cavity prevention and gum care. Well, the new SF products (with metallic aftertaste) are repulsive. I didn't use it long enough to find out if it would stain my teeth, like other brands' stannous fluoride versions, but I expect that it would. So, Colgate lost yet another customer, as I have switched to basic Crest with sodium fluoride; I don't love it like I loved my old Colgate, but at least it's not disgusting.",1 stars
New formula is not effective,2nd August 2019,"Been a loyal user of Colgate Total clean mint for years. When a consumer goes online trying to figure out what the deal is with a product that went from great to horrible, there's a significant problem. I see I am not the only one not satisfied with the formula change. There's an old saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I will be putting my money where my mouth is & switching brands.",1 stars
Ugh they changed the flavor!!,1st August 2019,"I've been a loyal Colgate user for over 30 years. Imagine my surprise when I opened my new box of Colgate and brushed my teeth only to find they changed the flavor - and the new flavor is HORRID!!!! There was no indication on the box that the flavor was different - just a small note on the tube itself that says ""new flavor."" The flavor was so bad I threw the toothpaste out and bought a tube of crest. The worst part - I bought it at a bulk club store and can't return the other 4 tubes!!",1 stars
PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA,31st July 2019,"This is a terrible replacement for the previous formula. Colgate Total Clean Mint Toothpaste has been the ONLY toothpaste I ever use because it is simply so wonderful. Leaves me with a clean mouth and it tastes great. This new one is so awful. Seriously. I will not buy it, and none of your other options come close to the one I have loved for decades. Please come to your senses and bring it back.",1 stars
Disgusting aftertaste,31st July 2019,"I've used Colgate loyally for years and was shocked at how horrible the new SF toothpaste tastes, both while brushing but especially afterwards! The aftertaste lingers for hours and is just horrific. I went back to the store after just one use to look for the old formula but it seems to have been pulled from the shelves for some reason (?!) I bought a second flavor of Colgate SF, this one with a ""fresh mint"" and switching away from whitening for the first time in years. Same disgusting after taste! Will be throwing both tubes away and switching brands for the first time in my life.",1 stars
HATE new flavor - was any testing done?!,30th July 2019,"I am someone who also brushes my tongue with a firm toothbrush after brushing my teeth with a soft brush. I am VERY sensitive to a clean tongue. Only Colgate's old Whitening toothpaste did the trick! This new flavor leaves a bad taste on my tongue and in my mouth. I'm sure the other ingredients are good for teeth but why not let us CHOOSE our flavor? When we have a zillion choices of flavors on so many other products, how can it be that such a popular huge brand like Colgate can't ADD a new toothpaste/flavor and still keep the old?!! I bought 5 other flavors of Colgate and Crest to try them all and see how they felt afterwards. NONE work as well. I'm sad, disappointed, and devastated.",1 stars
Disappointed,29th July 2019,"I have bought ONLY Clean Mint for years for my family and myself. The new formula, packaged to mimic the old, has left us disappointed and looking for a new toothpaste. My daughter nearly threw up the first time she used it. I noticed a burning sensation at first that became minty, followed by a film left in my mouth that tasted bad for hours. Please bring back the original formula.",1 stars
New Flavor Sucks,28th July 2019,"I don't usually write reviews, but i felt this was necessary. My family and I been users of the original Colgate Total Clean Mint for years, decades for myself, and we loved it. The new formula simply said, SUCKS. The taste is horrible and leaves an aftertaste. Unfortunately, neither one of us Will use it and refuse to buy this product any more. Please bring back the original formula! Regards, a former valued customer",1 stars
Horrible Taste,28th July 2019,"I don't usually write reviews, but I felt this was necessary. My family and I have been users of the original Colgate Total Clean Mint for years, decades for myself, and we loved it. The new formula simply said, SUCKS.

Hate the new flavor,28th July 2019,"I've used Colgate Total for years and was very happy with it. The new flavor is terrible, and I will be switching brands with my next tube.",1 stars
"New flavor, had to switch brands",26th July 2019,"I have been using COLGATE TOTAL CLEAN MINT TOOTHPASTE for years and years, but I can't stand the new flavor with sucralose. I have permanently switched brands, but would love to switch back if you go back to the old formula. It sounds silly, but I really miss my old toothpaste!",1 stars
What a terrible new formula with a terrible taste!,26th July 2019,"I can only second the bad remarks written by other consumers of the new formula of the Colgate Total Whitening toothpaste. I was a huge fan and a very frequent user of the previous version, but you just lost me with the new formula. The taste is not good, and it leaves an even horrible aftertaste in the mouth. I'm exploring the market now, but I won't spend an additional euro on Colgate!",1 stars
You ruined a great toothpaste,23rd July 2019,"I have used this for 10 years and absolutely loved it. I bought a tube yesterday and almost threw up as I started brushing. I looked at the tube and noticed ""New Flavor."" If the New Flavor is supposed to taste like a chemical plant in New Jersey, you did great. And the aftertaste is horrible. PLEASE recognize that you made a BAD business decision and REVERSE. You are about to lose a ton of business. And don't you dare respond to this review asking me to call you so we can talk about it!",1 stars
I'm so sad it changed,22nd July 2019,I loved Colgate Total and used it for years! But I had to stop using it with the new fluoride flavor - it's terrible! Please bring back my favorite minty clean toothpaste without the fluoride :(,1 stars
Disgusting,21st July 2019,"They changed the formula of all of the Total line without warning or cause. Colgate Sensitive was already a thing. Why introduce an everyday toothpaste that says right on the label to not use for more than four weeks? No worries, you won't have my business for longer than that. Horrible business decision. Bring back the old version.",1 stars
Gross new taste,18th July 2019,"I have used total for my entire life almost and today I just used a new tube with the ""improved taste"" logo. It was awful and I feel like I didn't even brush my teeth. I will be throwing out the remaining 4 tubes I have and buying a different brand today. Any suggestions on better tasting non whitening brands?!!",1 stars
I would never buy this product again!!!,18th July 2019,I've been using Total Colgate clear mint for as long as I can remember (over 3 decades) & I loved it!! Just recently I bought the new version with SF without realizing it & as soon as I was brushing my teeth I felt something was off. The flavor was horrible & my teeth didn't feel clean like they used to before. Will definitely be switching to a different brand until hopefully one day you bring the original version back.,1 stars
Horrible Lingering Aftertaste,18th July 2019,"I've only ever bought Colgate Total (since it's been on the market), but this new SF is horrible! There was a disgusting aftertaste that lasted for hours! I thought it was just me, but my husband had the same complaint. This is our only option now for Total?? If so, I'm going to have to switch brands.",1 stars
Ruined a great product,17th July 2019,"I've been using your Clean Mint formula for years. When I got my newest tube, I thought I had bought a stale tube of toothpaste. After looking more closely, I see you've changed the formula. Why spoil a good toothpaste with a sensitivity formula when you have other toothpastes that directly are for sensitivity issues? Fortunately, I have other alternatives or this would just be another ""New Coke"" situation.",1 stars
I really dislike the new flavor,16th July 2019,I have used Colgate toothpaste for at least 30 years. I do not like the new flavor. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It seems like they put more baking soda and added lemon flavor to the toothpaste. I am now using a different brand that has a better flavor with no after taste. Colgate really got this wrong.,1 stars
How to lose all your customers in one easy step,15th July 2019,"How do I hate this? Let me count the ways. First off, calling the taste of this new formula a New Flavor is being way too generous unless you somehow think that Horrible Chemical is the new Mint. Secondly, after using this for the first time last night, instead of my mouth feeling clean and refreshed like it always did with the old Colgate, my mouth was dry, my teeth didn't even feel ckean, and there was an absolutely awful aftertaste that lasted all night. Thirdly, stannous fluoride stains the teeth, so unless Advanced Whitening is your euphemism for Yellowing, I think a new name is in order. I have used Colgate Total for many years, but no more. I considered giving the rest of my supply to a local aid group, but have decided that throwing it in the trash so it can't harm anybody is the only charitable thing to do.",1 stars
Used to be a good toothpaste,15th July 2019,This used to be a really good toothpaste. I am having to switch because of the addition of sensitivity control. They have also change the flavor and the mint is so strong it burns your teeth and gums and tongue. The old formula was so much better. The addition of sensitivity control can give some people a spontaneous tooth pain. That's what has happened in my family. After 40 years of using Colgate we are switching. Sorry for the changes.,1 stars
Did you user-test the new taste?!,13th July 2019,I've used Colgate Total since it came out and haven't wanted to ever use anything else. This new flavor is absolutely horrible. I can't believe that the product manager did any useful user testing - it surely would've gotten rejected quickly. What products can I buy that don't have this awful taste? Hoping I can still get something that tastes good.,1 stars
an abomination,A Tesco Customer12th July 2019,"foul tasting abomination, saccharine soaked vile product",1 stars
Finally a better Total Toothpaste,12th July 2019,Finally Total got with the program and eliminated the horrible triclosan from the toothpaste. The old total had a terrible taste and used a terrible ingredient. New formula with stannous Floride is a huge improvement. Taste great and has added benefits. Now there are two reputable companies that have stannous fluoride in their toothpaste. Colgate total SF and Crest Prohealth.,5 stars
Gross new flavor,12th July 2019,"I am not sure what happened to the flavor from the last Total toothpaste but this is seriously, YUCK. It tastes like licking baking soda and no longer has a nice minty after taste. What the heck??! I have used this product for years and now I have to go find a new toothpaste.",1 stars
Hate the new formula,11th July 2019,"Didn't realize the product had changed when I bought a 2 pack (my bad)....they switched from Sodium Fluoride to Stannous Fluoride which my teeth/gums apparently don't like, that's why I went back to using the original Colgate Total my dentist had given me and my gums felt much better. Will be on the search again for another brand......",1 stars
"Love Total, but absolutely hate the new flavor",11th July 2019,"I loved Total in the past and have been a very long term user, but the new flavor is awful, it burns my mouth and it lingers so long the taste of food tastes like mint. PLEASE give us a choice of old flavor and new. I have 5 tubes of the new and can't return because I already took them out of the box. Have switched to Crest :-( Please fix this Colgate!",1 stars
New flavor is horrible,10th July 2019,"I have used Colgate for over 40 years. Last night I used a new tube and couldn't believe how bad it tasted. Not only was the taste bad when brushing, but then the nasty aftertaste just lingered. I took a closer look at the tube and find out it is a new flavor. Please bring back the original flavor. As it stands now I have a two pack of toothpaste that I will probably end up throwing out since I dread having to taste it. Not the best quality in a toothpaste. Unless I can find the original flavor I'll be searching for a new brand.",1 stars
HORRIBLE NEW PRODUCT,8th July 2019,"OK so my family has used this toothpaste for years. At first glance, I didn't notice the change to the packaging. After first use, it is very evident that the product changed. The taste is horrible, the aftertaste is even worse. Not only that, but it doesn't leave your mouth feeling clean at all. I had to search around town to find any of the old product left and that has finally ran out. Now we will be switching to a different product/brand all together. Very disappointed in Colgate",1 stars
What have you done to Colgate Total.,6th July 2019,"Been using Colgate Total for almost two decades. I has always been the ultimate toothpaste. The new formula is disgrace. It leaves a terrible sour taste in my mouth, teeth don't feel clean at all. Bring back the old formula!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???",1 stars
Hate this new toothpaste,6th July 2019,This new Colgate total sf toothpaste sucks. Has a terrible taste & leaves a weird sensation/residue. Please allow consumers the option to buy the original Colgate total toothpaste again. Thank you.,1 stars
HORRIBLE WAKE UP COLGATE,5th July 2019,"This is a problem I can't believe we are having to face, you just count on some things to stay the same. My husband and myself cannot believe how BAD tasting the new colgate is and how it makes your mouth feel weird. I have been a user my entire life 58 years, I have to find some of the old Colgate, until I talk with my hygienist, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back the old Colgate Total Whitening. You really are shooting yourself in the foot.....all of your loyal consumers will be buying something else as soon as we find it.....PLEASE WE BEG YOU, THIS IS OUR MOUTH WE NEED THE OLD COLGATE!!!!!!",1 stars
New Flavor is terrible,4th July 2019,Why did you change the flavor? The new taste is off-putting. How many consumer tests did you do because this was a bad move.,2 stars
"Colgate Total SF Clean Mint - horrible new flavor, same name",4th July 2019,"I loved the regular Colgate Total Clean Mint & have used it for years. The new Total SF Clean Mint says new flavor but it's the same flavor name. The new flavor is horrible - it doesn't taste good, it leaves a weird aftertaste in my mouth & it doesn't leave my mouth feeling as clean / refreshed. The original Clean Mint flavor was great - not too overpowering minty, but was still refreshing. This new ""Clean Mint"" flavor is not even close & shouldn't have the same name. PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL!!!!",1 stars
Replaced triclosan for SF and lost both flavor and favor,3rd July 2019,"So Colgate changed their formula. They dropped the triclosan for SF. Said also, ""new flavor"". More like a blah for me. While I have not felt the pain as others, I've not really enjoyed brushing with this new formula either. Currently researching other brands, maybe Tom's of Maine, Enamalon, who knows. Sad. I really used to like the previous version. Wonder how they came up with this version? Don't they have ""taste testers""? It may be ok to them but certainly not ""fresh "" tasting for me. :(",3 stars
New flavor is awful,2nd July 2019,I've been using Colgate for years. I love the clean mint regular toothpaste. I usually buy the value 2pk which lasts a long time. Just the other day I bought what I thought was the same thing. I started brushing my teeth and was shocked and the bad taste. The tube says new flavor but the box does not. That is deceiving. It is now for sensitivity? Why put that in with regular? Most people don't need it. Please bring the original flavor back! I might have to try Crest in the mean time .,1 stars
Tastes BAD!!!!,2nd July 2019,Would NOT recommend to anyone!!! Tate's so bad!! Stopped using this toothpaste! Was a Great product......,1 stars
Terrible taste,27th June 2019,I've used Colgate for years. I may have to throw the tube away it tastes so awful! I'm going to have to find something else!,1 stars
New Taste is HORRIBLE!,27th June 2019,"I've used Colgate for decades to clean and protect my mouth and keep my teeth clean. Over the years the dentist has given me samples of other toothpastes, but they always tasted weird and didn't leave my mouth feeling clean so I always stuck with Colgate. Recently, I bought a new tube and was totally shocked by the taste. It is really, really horrible. I do not like the change to the new flavor. I really don't want to change toothpaste, but your new flavor is now leaving sores in my mouth. This has never happened before using Colgate, and was the main reason I never used any other toothpaste. Please go back to your original formula - it was fresh, clean, and effective!",1 stars
Terrible,26th June 2019,"We have used Colgate Total Clean Mint for awhile now and really liked it. The last few times I went to buy toothpaste all I could find was the Colgate Total SF Clean Mint. So that's what I got. I didn't read the package, because I thought it was the same toothpaste with a little something extra. I hate it! It made my mouth raw and caused sores where my gums meet the back of my lips. One day I just happened to look at the tube and saw that it says to only use for 4 weeks. What???? Repackage this toothpaste, so people don't think it's the normal Colgate Total Clean Mint. Because it isn't!!! Call it something else and change the look of the packaging. And if you've gotten rid of the original, bring it back. I can't find any Colgate Total Clean Mint other than this horrible SF one.",1 stars
"Not a good change, very disappointed",26th June 2019,"This was the ONLY toothpaste I could use, all others where to strong. My mouth burns with the new formula/ taste. WHY would you change something that was always great, I have lesions and sores in my mouth from from the harsh burn . I can't even use a gel formula. So my question, if you have to change WHY can't you keep the old formula also. I really hope maybe I can find the old formula somewhere, because I Definitely WILL NOT buy this again. I was always a faithful customer . Very dissappointed.",1 stars
"Been using Colgate 40+ years, looking for a new brand now!",25th June 2019,"Couldn't stand the taste long enough to tell if it has pros. What was wrong with the old flavor? This leaves your mouth with a bland taste and my teeth doesn't feel as clean as they did with the old flavor. If nothing else please give us a choice , instead of forcing people to consider other brands. This toothpaste us terrible. Have you tried it?",1 stars
New taste of Colgate Total Clean Mint,24th June 2019,"Did not realize the taste change, so my first thought was that I had purchased the wrong kind, but the box said Colgate Total clean mint - then I saw the fine print that said, ""new flavor"". I find the new taste extremely distasteful and do not like how my mouth feels after brushing. I bought a two pack that will be donated to someone in need. Will try a small tube of regular Colgate and see how that works. Have seen a lot of changes and discontinued items in my 74 years, but didn't realize how much I liked using your product - until you changed it. Really hoping that enough consumers will add their opinions, and you will rethink the taste change.",1 stars
The old formula was better,23rd June 2019,My whole family dislikes the new SF formula. We used Colgate Total for about 10 years. We're now looking for a new brand. It leaves a horrible after taste and metallic feeling.,1 stars
tastes terrible,23rd June 2019,"I have used only Colgate Total for years. The last tubes I bought were a new flavor- SF. It tastes terrible! The fresh taste of Total is gone. It has a sour after-taste. Hopefully the flavor can be changed back, so I can buy Total again!",1 stars
Disappointed,22nd June 2019,"I ALWAYS buy Colgate products and I have to say the ""New Taste"" is just awful! It is so awful I may just throw it away and buy something else. I will most definitely NOT continue to buy Colgate if this is really the tase they are going to stay with. My family also agrees that the taste is not good at all. Sorry Colgate but you got it wrong this time :(",1 stars
Horrific new taste,21st June 2019,Horrible new taste. I'm hard core passionate about Colgate but this new taste makes me want to switch to the toothpaste I've hated my whole life. Crest has aways been the worst possible alternative in my life but I'd happily use Crest instead of this horrible new taste that Colgate has switched to. Please change back. This is beyond gross!,1 stars
Terrible new flavor,20th June 2019,"Have used Total for years, also recommend by dentist. New flavor is terrible, threw it away and bought a new brand.",1 stars
Disgusting flavor,20th June 2019,"Disgusting flavor; tastes like menthol and burns the tongue. Why change a great product? Colgate Total Advanced Whitening gel was great. This ""new"" flavor leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The old one was refreshing and this one is not. I kept wanting to rinse my mouth out after brushing with it. I'm disappointed and hope it changes back to the original flavor. Will be throwing the whole tube out ... what a waste of money.",1 stars
Please Go Back to Old Formula,20th June 2019,"I'm reading the same reviews over and over again. I don't want to write the same, but can't help it! This new formula is trash. The taste is terrible. I have been using Colgate total for years and it's so upsetting that I have to go on a hunt for a new toothpaste. I've been getting the little dollar samples of other brands and I'm not satisfied with any of them. Please, please go back to the old formula! Please!",1 stars
Very Unhappy with New Formula,20th June 2019,"I grabbed what I thought was my regular 2-pack of Total Clean Mint paste. When I opened the box, the first thing I noticed was the tube is smaller. Then, comparing to the old tube, I saw that the formula was different. (I was hoping I'd just grabbed the wrong thing). As the box was open, I tried it. I'm very, very unhappy. The mint isn't minty and the paste foams way too much. But the worst thing is it doesn't leave my mouth feeling clean. It leaves a chalky residue - I assume from the ""Sensitivity"" ingredient. Now I have two tubes that don't like, and I have to find a new toothpaste.",1 stars
I'm looking for a new toothpaste after 47 years!,19th June 2019,"I have used Colgate products for 47 years. I love the old Clean Mint. My mouth felt clean and fresh for hours after use. The new SF Colgate has a terrible taste that leaves your teeth and mouth with a horrible after taste. After using the new SF toothpaste for a week, I started to develop sores in my mouth. I stopped using the SF toothpaste and the sores went away. I'm currently trying to find a new toothpaste! With the metallic taste the toothpaste leaves in your mouth, this can't be good for you!!",1 stars
It tastes bad now.,18th June 2019,"The flavor of this toothpaste is horrible and I have been using Colgate toothpaste (not gel) for over 60 years. Consumers are insignificant it appears, because we need your products. There are just too many toothpaste formula versions and the change of flavor is not indicated on the box, only on the tube. Now I have to spend extra money and time to test new toothpastes. Also, all you businesses want my information, to track my computer and give third parties my information. Please DO NOT give my personal and tracking information out to third parties, since I have to agree to your terms and privacy policies. It appears that we consumers have no rights.",1 stars

New flavoring is disgusting,17th June 2019,"I've been using this for years and loved it but the new flavor is disgusting, almost like a pepper flavored mint. So bad I just threw away the tube after a few nights of trying and got out the sample tube (another brand) from my last dental cleaning appointment to use as an alternate.",1 stars
Bleeding gums returned...,17th June 2019,"I've used the original Colgate Total for years. The product containing Triclosan saved my gums. Within the first week of using the new SF formula, bleeding returned and my teeth were left feeling gritty. The old product was powerful enough to reverse gum disease and the new product has allowed it to come back. To say I'm unhappy is an understatement. Please bring back the old formula. I don't want my gum disease to return, which it appears it already has.",1 stars
Horrible new formula,15th June 2019,I've used Colgate advanced whitening since it came out. So disappointed with this new formula. It taste so bad and leaves my mouth feeling dry for hours after I brush my teeth. I am switching to a new toothpaste.,1 stars
New Flavor Not Pleased,14th June 2019,"I have been using this toothpaste for a long time. I am 58 years old. Bought a new tube, tried it and immediately could tell something wasn't right.

Terrible change,12th June 2019,This new formula is terrible. It does not leave my mouth feeling clean at all but instead creates a horrible film/residue feeling on the inside of my whole mouth. I have been using this toothpaste for years and now am going to have to search for a new toothpaste. All of the other poor reviews are spot on - this product change is very disappointing.,1 stars
Awful new taste.,12th June 2019,New taste is awful pleas bring back the old flavor. Colgate total advanced whitening gel. The new flavor is terrible. Tastes chalky and leaves a residue on your teeth.,1 stars

I will never buy this version again; bring back w/out SF,11th June 2019,"I have used Colgate Total Clean Mint Paste forever, literally. I'm 67. I bought a new tube the other day and didn't notice the SF on it. Couldn't figure out why it tasted awful while brushing and left a bad taste in my mouth. Figuring it was a fluke, I used it again the next day and found it did the same thing. I finally noticed the SF and Sensitivity Relief on the tube. Compared it to the old tube (still in my trash can) and found out why it was so bad. I am not one of those people who need sensitivity relief. I do not like the new taste, nor do I feel like everybody needs to be treated for sensitivity relief. Unless you end up changing your tune and making the old formula available as well, I will be searching for a Stannous Fluoride free alternative elsewhere.... Colgate has been my brand FOREVER. You just lost me.",1 stars
Gross! Never again!,11th June 2019,I have used Colgate my whole life and this particular kind for many many years. Opened up a new tube yesterday and was shocked at the disgusting taste. Will have to get rid of this tube and find a new brand of toothpaste. Gross!!!!,1 stars
"Terrible ""New Flavor""",10th June 2019,"My family and I have used this toothpaste for years. We all hate the new taste and are hopeful, based on all of the bad reviews, that you will bring back the original flavor. We disposed of all of the ""new flavor"" tubes and switched to Crest. We will stay with Crest until a better-tasting Colgate Advanced Whitening comes back.",1 stars
Disappointed in New Flavor,10th June 2019,"I always buy this toothpaste and usually love it, but now with the 'new flavor' I'm not going to buy it anymore. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

New flavor is awful!,9th June 2019,"I thought I bought the wrong product by mistake, but then realized it's just been reformulated. The new flavor is awful, does not leave fresh feeling, sharp tingling sensation while brushing, then bad long lingering aftertaste. Really disappointed as I loved this product until now.",1 stars
PLEASE CHANGE THE FORMULA BACK!!!!!,7th June 2019,"The new SF formula of Colgate Total Advanced Health is horrible!!!!! It has caused chafing of my gums, numbness, and sore, red gums as well. I definitely hope Colgate gets enough complaints to change the formula back, because I used it for decades and loved it. Now, I have to throw it in the garbage, it is awful!!!!!",1 stars
"Terrible ""new flavor""!",6th June 2019,"I never get on a manufacturer's website to leave a comment - until now. I got on here to see if I could figure out whether this Total Whitening ""new flavor"" is just an option, but it appears to be the only option. Like the other recent comments I am seeing, my family hates it. If we can't find any of the old flavor on the shelves, we will be switching brands after 15+ years with Colgate Total (changed back then based on a dentist raving about the patented Total formula).",1 stars
Awful Taste and Over Foaming Toothpaste!!,5th June 2019,Will never buy this product again! Bought it thinking it was the usual Clean Mint Paste I always bought. But then tried it and almost threw up. I'm not joking. The flavor is terrible and formula is different from before. It taste stale or moldy and when brushing the paste turns way too foamy which makes you want to throw up. The old formula was amazing! Why would they change such a great product? So disappointed that I need to find a new toothpaste.,1 stars
DanZ,5th June 2019,This is the most disgusting tooth paste I have ever used. I have used the Advanced Whiting for as long as i can remember. I will now switch to another company. Why did they even mess with a great tooth paste? The really need to go back to the original one. I thought my wife picked up the wrong one. She did not. A wast of money for sure. In the trash it went.,1 stars
Hate the taste. Bring back the old version.,4th June 2019,I loved the old Advanced White Gel. This new one tastes awful.,1 stars
"NOOOOooooooo! Love you guys, but...",4th June 2019,"As a decade long, loyal customer, I must take the time to write and let you know that I don't like the ""new flavor""; to me, it tastes like old, bad gum. I LOVE your original flavor and it was amazing how clean and refreshing it was. It was so good, that I often felt like it was as clean feeling as mouthwash. Hope you can bring back the original - or do both! Thanks! Bill in Colorado",1 stars

Terrible,3rd June 2019,OMG! Whoever is making the decisions to get rid of your number one selling product because you have a new product on the market deserves to be FIRED! This new brand of toothpaste you have on the market is HORRIBLE. It does not freshen breath like your 12hr advance fresh cleaning toothpaste use. It is a worthless product that makes you feel like you need to brush your teeth 10 times. If you are a person who likes fresh breath and for their teeth to be clean then do not try Colgates new product. They are trying to lose customers.,1 stars
Horrible Taste!!!,2nd June 2019,"Absolutely horrible taste! I could not stand to leave it in my mouth more than a few seconds. Threw it away. I have used the old formula as long as I can remember, now I have to find a new brand. I won't be buying this.",1 stars
Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Bring back the old formula!!,1st June 2019,This new stannous floride flavor that Colgate decided to add to their toothpaste is by far the worst decision ever! reading other reviews I'm obviously not the only one with the same views. This toothpaste leaves a sour taste no matter how much I rinse and doesn't give you fresh breath at all Note to Colgate: bring back old formula asap or you'll end up losing customers to other brands. I myself will be switching to a different brand probably Crest for now It's such a shame since I've been a Colgate user practically my whole life,1 stars

New Flavor is Nasty,28th May 2019,"I have been a Colgate user since I started brushing my teeth. I was surprised to see that Total was changed with a ""new flavor"", without any mention on the box. I almost returned the tube thinking it was a defect. I'm not sure why you had to mess with the flavor. The reason I use Colgate is because I like the way it tastes. This new flavor is terrible, and it leaves a nasty aftertaste. I like the original Colgate flavor, and no, I'm not interested in trying one of your new flavors. For that I'll go elsewhere. My Colgate days are over.",1 stars
Tastes awful now,28th May 2019,"I used this Colgate toothpaste for years and loved the taste. The most recent tube I purchased advertised a new ingredient on the outside of the box - but didn't say anything about a new taste. I used it without looking closely at the tube - and couldn't believe how awful it tasted. THEN I saw that the tube has a banner saying ""New taste!"" The new taste is simply awful. It leaves a sour aftertaste. I've now switched to Arm & Hammer which, while not tasting as good as the old Colgate, tastes better than the new Colgate.",1 stars
Can't Stand the New Flavor,27th May 2019,I have been a loyal user of Colgate Total Advanced Whitening Paste for years and I was so shocked by the new taste. It's really unpleasant. I am trying to find a tube of the original stuff anywhere! Please re-continue producing the previous formula!,1 stars

New goopy paste with sour aftertaste,22nd May 2019,"The new formula does not leave a minty fresh mouth like the previous formula did. It tastes kind of sour and a bit like brushing your teeth with baking soda. The paste itself is now runny and goopy. I am shocked that this passed the product testing floor - if it actually ever went to the floor. After 15-20 years of using this variety, I am now looking for a new toothpaste.",1 stars
Terrible aftertaste!,22nd May 2019,I have was always a Colgate user. I am 56 and my entire family uses your toothpaste.

"The ""New Flavor"" is terrible. Switching to another brand.",20th May 2019,"I've used Colgate for as long as I can remember. Your switch to this ""New Flavor"" has me switching to another brand of toothpaste. The packaging barely notes the new flavor. The new flavor is absolutely terrible.

I would not purchase again,18th May 2019,I have used Colgate Total Clean Mint Paste for many many years and now I cannot stand the taste of the new formula in my mouth. The taste literally makes me gag. I called Colgate to ask what had happened and they simply told me that they added stannous flouride. I can no longer use it. I have to find a new brand. What on earth was Colgate thinking? Bad idea...even worse taste! Bye Bye Colgate.,1 stars
Please bring back the old flavor!,17th May 2019,"I am so bummed with the formula change of the Colgate Total. I have been using this paste for years. Now I will have to switch to a different brand. I am a dental hygienist and hate the Crest Pro Health products because of the use of the Stannous Fluoride as it stains the teeth and leaves mouths of my patients with a residue (my self included) which sloughs their tissues. I hate the new flavor, and wish you would bring back the original!",1 stars

Why change a good thing?,17th May 2019,"The original formula used to be my favorite toothpaste. It was the perfect all around toothpaste. Now that they added stannous fluoride, it's horrible now.

New formula is awful,16th May 2019,"I've been strictly using Colgate Total Advanced Whitening for years now. This new formula tastes really bad, doesn't foam up, irritates my gums, and sheds the lining of my mouth! Really hope they fix this soon or go back to the old formula.",1 stars

Please bring back the old gel formula as this is TERRIBLE. I was a dedicated Colgate Total Gel user but need to now find a new brand. I will make it a point to not buy Colgate but will check back to see if it has been brought back. Please consider and please fire the people who spear headed this to change.

Why change a good thing??,14th May 2019,I've been a Colgate user for as long as I can remember. Bought a twin pack of this not realizing the mistake I made. Why oh why the change in formula?!?

Very upset when I went to buy my toothpaste,14th May 2019,Been using the old formula for over a year consistently. Never told my dental hygienist I had done anything different and instantly she seen something was different and asked what I had done. It's the only toothpaste I have ever used that made my mouth and teeth feel clean. I can't use sensitivity toothpaste regularly because it causes me issues. Now I can't use my toothpaste because of this change. Very upset!,1 stars
Bring back the Sodium fluoride!,12th May 2019,"Colgate has always been my personal favorite brand and I always have recommended Colgate Total toothpaste to my patients. When I heard that Colgate was going to implement stannous fluoride I had assumed it would just be an option and that I could still purchase Colgate Total with sodium fluoride. However, I am now very disappointed to learn that the Colgate Total line contains stannous fluoride exclusively. Stannous fluoride is very irritating to gum tissues and I have yet to come across anyone that it did not cause a reaction to, this includes myself, my fellow dental professionals, my patients and my own family. I cannot use this toothpaste anymore or recommend it. As Dental professional and a die-hard Colgate fan, I urge you to bring back the Sodium Fluoride in your total line!",1 stars
I have used Total for many years,12th May 2019,The old total had two active ingredients. Triclosan was one of them and the (proven) claim was that it was effective.

Bring back the old formula!,10th May 2019,"Just here to add to the reviews asking for the old formula back. Tried the new formula for about a week and it's stripped the inside lining of my mouth, skin peeling off my gums and the inside walls of my cheeks, also left my lips dried and chapped. Found a tube of the old formula and these problems were solved in less than a day! Hoping Colgate will make the change for its loyal Customers - at least sell the old formula alongside its new line to give Customers the option. I don't want to, but if Colgate doesn't make the change, I'll be forced to find another brand.",1 stars
Disappointed!,9th May 2019,My husband and I have used nothing but Colgate Total Whitening paste. This new flavor is so disappointing. It has a terrible taste and does not seem to clean like what we have always used. We will continue using Total if we can find some that doesn't have this new flavor but if we cannot we will have to change toothpastes.,1 stars
The New Taste is horrible,9th May 2019,"I have been loyal to Colgate for over 50 years, until now. The new flavor is horrible. Leaves a bitter aftertaste in my mouth for hours. Time to switch to Crest or some other brand.",1 stars

Terrible aftertaste,7th May 2019,"I've been a Colgate user for many years, and have never thought to review the product... I was just a loyal customer.

I guess I'll have to find another toothpaste.",1 stars
"Terrible new flavor, wish I'd kept the box :(",7th May 2019,New flavor? Why? Clean Mint has been my favorite toothpaste for years. Nice fresh taste without being too minty or leaving a burning Sensation. New flavor is metallic tasting and almost foams up like baking soda formulas which I dislike.,1 stars
THE NEW COLGATE SF IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!,7th May 2019,"I don't know why they remove the previous Colgate formula from the market. I already bought many of these different new Colgate. The Advanced Whitening SF gave me sensitivity in all my teeth. The Clean Mint SF"" gave me sensitivity again. Additionally, I feel my teeth dirty after brush, and it started staining my teeth. I have been using Colgate during my entire life. Since they removed it from the market, it has been a nightmare. I will no longer use Colgate. As soon as I find a better brand, I will switch. I want to ask you that you, please return to the previous formula.",1 stars

The new flavor does not leave my mouth feeling clean, like it used to. Toothpaste is thinner, like whitening toothpaste, which I don't like. Leaves a bad aftertaste. Very disappointing to change something so great.",1 stars
BAD TASTE,5th May 2019,"This was my second time purchasing this ""new taste"" toothpaste. It is disgusting...leaves a vile metallic, medicinal after taste in your mouth. I have been a longtime, almost forever Colgate user and may now need to switch to another brand as I prefer paste instead of gel. Please Colgate go back to the previous ""clean mint paste"" flavor.",1 stars
SF,3rd May 2019,I have been using Colgate total advanced toothpaste for years I was very disappointed with the taste of the new SF version. I found a couple of old tubes without SF in a local store and purchased quickly. The flavor of the new toothpaste does not leave a good taste in your mouth. After my last two tubes of toothpaste are done I may have to try a crest product.,1 stars
I won't buy this product again,2nd May 2019,I have used Colgate total for years. I purchased a new tube this week and thought I had made a mistake because of the terrible taste left in my mouth and the sensation of a film on my tongue and cheeks. I have now discovered the NEW formula is in all their toothpastes. It is awful. I will be returning this product and will sadly stop buying Colgate.,1 stars
"The ""new flavor"" made me think I bought a bad batch",1st May 2019,"I have been using the Colgate Total fresh mint paste toothpaste for probably between 13 and 15 years. It's been my go-to toothpaste. This week I went to buy more and did not notice the ""new taste"" on the tube nor the Box. When I used it I assumed I bought a bad batch because it pretty much is flavorless and tastes more like baking soda mixed with some peroxide. Anyways the second time I used it I asked my wife if she knows the taste is different. She then informed me that the box in the tubes claimed to have a new taste. Gosh I don't know who tested this product and gave it a thumbs-up but the original taste is much better than this new taste. I'll have to go out and find the old original taste somewhere and stock up on it before it's replaced with this new taste which is pretty tasteless unless you like baking soda kind of aftertaste. Please go back to the original flavor or taste!",1 stars
AWFUL,1st May 2019,Whatever SF is that you all added tastes awful. Why did you have to change something that wasn't broken. EWWW!!,1 stars
I love this new formula!!,1st May 2019,"I typically brush my teeth twice a day. Once before I go to work at night, then another time when I get off work in the morning. I brush them again if I eat something with a lot of sugar. This new formula makes my breath extremely fresh & lasts for a long time. I also love how clean it makes my mouth feel.",5 stars
I hate the new formula,30th April 2019,"I have used Colgate total for years, because they stopped making my last favorite product. I grabbed the new total formulation, because it was the only thing on the shelves. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and feels chalky. It doesn't leave my mouth fresh at all. Do you still have a product similar to the old stuff?",1 stars
New formula burns my tongue!,29th April 2019,"I have been a long time user of Colgate Total Advanced Whitening Toothpaste, however, I will be finding a new toothpaste - probably with Crest since this new Colgate formulation is AWFUL. I tried using it twice, and both times it caused a burning sensation on my tongue. Don't ruin a good thing...if something isn't broke, don't fix it.",1 stars
They switched the ingredient!,29th April 2019,"They changed the ingredient to Stannous Fluoride, which sucks! It WILL stain your teeth. The whole reason I use to use Colgate Total vs Crest Pro Health is because Colgate had Sodium Fluoride vs the Stannous Fluoride found in Crest toothpaste. I can't believe that Colgate has now switched over to Stannous Fluoride. This stuff also tastes terrible and doesn't clean as well as the old formula did. I will never understand why companies try to ""fix"" what isn't broken. The old formula was PERFECT. This one is terrible.",1 stars
I would not buy this product again and again,29th April 2019,This new Colgate total is a disgrace. Whos idea was it to change this once great product they should be fired. What are the reasons for the change in manufacturing was it to keep costs down I would like to know. I guess it's time to look to Crest for an equivalent because you don't have one.,1 stars
The new formula tears my gums up. It's awful!!!,28th April 2019,"I have been a long time user of Colgate. Almost 30 years. I loved the Colgate Advance Whitening. However, the new flavor is horrible. It taste bad and it is tearing up my gums. I went to look for another kind of Colgate and was disappointed to find so many of the Colgate toothpaste are advertising this new formula. I am currently looking for a new brand. Colgate ruined a good thing",1 stars
Bring back Old Advanced Whitening Flavor!,26th April 2019,"I live in the Greater Cincinnati which is P&G country. Most people I know around here are faithful to Crest. I have a friendl who suggested Colgate years ago, I loved it and used Total Advanced Whitening. I had a little stock pile of it and ran out. I bought a new double pack last week. I noticed right away the flavor is different. I took a closer look at the tube and saw an SF on it. I also noticed it said new flavor. It is HORRIBLE tasting and leaves a long lasting bitter after taste. I have tried other flavors of Colgate but only liked Advanced Whitening. I will be going back to Crest. So disappointed. Please bring back the old flavor!!!",1 stars

Terrible!!!,26th April 2019,"I love the original great taste not too minty. Just the right consistency. This ""new flavor"" is just awful the smell is off putting. The texture is disgusting I nearly threw up. If you want to bring in new flavors great but don't replace something that's already perfect.",1 stars
New Colgate,24th April 2019,"I have been a Colgate user for many years. I am sorry to say the new Colgate Total sf whole mouth health is awful. Please consider sodium fluoride instead of the stannous fluoride, make it great again!",1 stars
Please bring back the old version,24th April 2019,I'm 60 years old and I've been using Colgate toothpaste since early childhood and Colgate Total since it first came out. I've always liked the taste until now. The new formula tastes terrible and leaves a metallic taste in my mouth. I also noticed that Colgate Total is no longer ADA approved. Luckily my supermarket still has the old version so I grabbed a couple of tubes. When they run out I'm going to have to find a new toothpaste brand.,1 stars
Go back to original formula,23rd April 2019,The taste of the new formula is horrible and made me almost throw up. I returned the two pack I had purchased. Please go back to the original formula.,1 stars
New formula is horrible,23rd April 2019,I have been using Colgate Total Advanced Whitening for YEARS. It's literally the only toothpaste I could buy that wouldn't irritate my mouth but still give me great freshness. I am not at all pleased with the new flavor. It's horrible. Please bring back the previous Colgate Total Advanced Whitening! I will be on the lookout for a different toothpaste. Really hope you will listen to all these unhappy customers and bring back the previous product!,1 stars
teath feel like moss coating after brushing,22nd April 2019,"I was a constant user of the old formula & would use nothing else.The old formula of Total - Clean Mint left my teeth felling smooth and had a great taste. The new formula has an unpleasant taste and my teeth feel like moss is growing on them after brushing. I stopped buying the new formula. I wish Colgate would bring back the old formula. The new formula is a giant step backwards. I would have rated this product ""No Stars"" but the system would not let me. So I gave it 1 star so the would accept my negative review.",1 stars
what happened to Colgate CLEAN MINT? IS IT STILL BEING MADE?,20th April 2019,"what happened to colgate clean mint? I cannot find it lately. this product is horrible. it tastes horrible, the texture is all wrong, I want my old colgate total. I have used colgate all my life and I will not be buying again! this is like NEW COKE! leave well enough alone!",1 stars
Go back to the old formula!,19th April 2019,"The new SF formula is awful! I'm devastated because this has been MY toothpaste for 10 years! It tastes awful and I don't think the whitening is the same. Please change it back, Colgate! :(",1 stars
SF tastes horrible,18th April 2019,The SF has a horrible taste and after taste. Please bring back the original formula.,1 stars
Awful Aftertaste,18th April 2019,"The fact they add a ""New Flavor"" tag to the box and tube indicates a certain pride in their accomplishment. I was intrigued. I was deceived. The flavor I had reliably enjoyed for decades replaced with someone I can only describe as ""wrong"" and, unfortunately, ""long lasting."" Before realizing it was the toothpaste, I legitimately thought there was something wrong with me for about a week. I don't recommend this. Who would? Colgate, please do something about the awful flavor!",1 stars
Horrible change!,16th April 2019,"I have been using Colgate Advanced Fresh Whitening for years. Not realizing it had a ""new flavor"", I recently (unfortunately) bought a twin pack of it. The aftertaste it left in my mouth had me gagging. I guess I will be switching toothpastes. Why did you change the flavor? Don't fix it if it ain't broke!",1 stars
Just awful,16th April 2019,"I was afraid this would happen eventually, but I have not been able to use anything but your EXCELLENT Total Plus Whitening for the past 15 years (I even had it shipped abroad when I lived out of the country for a couple years) because it is the only paste I've found that keeps that fresh feel all day. I'm not usually even loyal to any particular brand, but no other paste I've tried can accomplish that. The new, disgusting SF formulation you apparently released and replaced all the good toothpaste with is just AWFUL. The taste is offensive and the sensation the new sensitivity drug leaves is abhorrent. Please, PLEASE tell me how I can continue to get back to the good stuff. I'm literally telling you to how take my money, just bring back the old formula! I'll even buy it up online, just give me a way!",1 stars
I despise the new flavor and the aftertaste is disgusting,16th April 2019,I've used Colgate for 55 years and I am switching to something else now. The taste is that bad.,1 stars
Terrible! Hate the new flavor.,15th April 2019,Just terrible. The new formula is not appealing to my family. The taste is horrible and the lasting flavor is unpleasing. So disappointed. We are now trying different brands to find a better option.,1 stars
New flavor is awful!,14th April 2019,My family has been Colgate Total users for years but the new flavor is awful. Not only is the taste bad but it leaves a lasting bad taste in your mouth for hours. We hate to change but we are done with Colgate Total. Wasn't this tested before the release?,1 stars
Goodbye Old Friend,14th April 2019,"This change in formula is terrible. The toothpaste has a very unpleasant taste, and texture. It also leaves a bad aftertaste, and makes my teeth sensitive. I have enjoyed using Colgate toothpastes for 30+ years, but will now be changing to another brand.",1 stars
"The ""new flavor"" is terrible. Absolutely, grotesque!",13th April 2019,The new flavor is quite harsh and unexpected. The outer packaging refers to new technology but the actual tube states NEW FLAVOR! Ruined. Just disappointing.,1 stars
After 30 years why did you change the flavor?????,13th April 2019,"I do not understand why companies have to change a product that were extremely well and had a great taste. In my past experience it has been a ""new marketing executive"" that thinks the change will be the best idea since bread. PLEASE bring back your previous formula. Also please keep the packaging easy to read with the basic information. I have had great results with using the previous formula and hope my teeth and gums are not being compromised.",1 stars
Bring back the original formula!!!!,12th April 2019,I am a Dental Hygienist and I have used Colgate Total since it first came out. I recently bought the new formula. It has Stannous Fluoride in it instead of Sodium Fluoride. Stannous Fluoride stains teeth and leaves your mouth dry. This toothpaste is a complete Crest copycat of the Crest Pro Health garbage. I am now searching for a new toothpaste.,1 stars
please bring back the old formula asap,10th April 2019,"Terrible , I have been using Colgate Total for many years. The new formula is just like crest now, it leaves my mouth watery and lingers in my mouth all day. Noticed a bad breath feeling during the night and that has never happened before. Please bring back a total original formula asap.",1 stars
Hate the taste,9th April 2019,I have used colgate total for years. Hate the new taste. I also tried the colgate max fresh breath strips. It left the minty taste all day. Which would be great if it didn't mess with flavors of you food. Yuck!,1 stars
"New formula is really, really awful",8th April 2019,"This is New Coke, but for toothpaste.",1 stars
From best flavor to worst... why?,8th April 2019,"I have been a diehard Colgate fan my whole life, great product and, until recently, unrivaled minty fresh flavor. This new flavor offends my mouth and leaves a terrible aftertaste. I literally have gone to multiple stores trying to find the old formula. I have no idea how this could have psssed user testing. Please bring back the old flavor!!! I don't want to have to find another toothpaste.",2 stars
PLEASE bring back the old flavor!,8th April 2019,"I have only bought Colgate clean mint for me and my family, the past 15 years, as it was the best on the market. The new taste isn't only bad, it leaves an aftertaste that lasts for hours, that is acidic, and nauseating!! Does ANYone actually like this? From your loyal customers - PLEASE switch back!!",1 stars
You are losing customers!,8th April 2019,Looks like you made a mistake! I'm adding to the list of bad reviews. I used the old Total because it was the only thing that made my mouth feel clean. The new flavor of Total is terrible. It does not make it feel clean. It has a terrible aftertaste. I don't want stannous fluoride in my toothpaste.,1 stars
No longer a Colgate user,7th April 2019,"I would give zero stars - Have used Colgate for decades. New formula is horribly messy, turns thin and runny the moment I start brushing. While the new taste is not good, as a lifelong Colgate fan I could try to get past the taste; the thin, foamy mess running out of my mouth as I attempt brushing makes the decision for me. I will definitely find another brand.",1 stars
Don't like the new taste,7th April 2019,I've used Colgate Total for years and have always loved it. I refused to use Crest Pro Health because I hate the way it tastes. Now Colgate went and changed the flavor to taste just like Crest Pro Health. There was nothing wrong with the previous flavor or formula. Please change it back!,1 stars
New flavor is awful,7th April 2019,"Gone through a tube and a half with my husband in an effort to get used to the new taste as they say, and nope. It doesn't leave me feeling fresh at all, quite the opposite, leaving a gross taste and feeling. I've used this as long as I can remember but I'll be switching for good.",1 stars
Bad taste,7th April 2019,I have always been a user of Colgate Total Clean Mint and thought I'd try this last week since I had a coupon to buy two tubes. Big mistake. It tastes bad and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I never noticed my own bad breath during the day and in the morning until using this. I never had an issue with Colgate Total before. Will not buy again. Anyone want my extra tube?,1 stars
The new formula has a bad taste,5th April 2019,"I use the product daily. Recently I bought a new tube and the new formula was all that was available. When I brushed my teeth, I noticed a big difference in the taste between the old formula and the new formula. The new formula does not have a good taste and it does not feel like it freshens breath as well as the old formula.",2 stars
Horrible change,5th April 2019,As a dental hygienist and a consumer for 25 years I am very disappointed with the change in your formula. I don't know why the original Colgate Total was removed from the market with triclosan. This new product is just horrible. It even taste horrible. I would love for someone to contact me and let me know where I can purchase the old formula.,1 stars
Giving up colgate,5th April 2019,"We have used colgate for years - I barely remember using anything else and I am 50. We have occasionally switched between types, and that doesn't bother me, in fact i quite like the bit of variety. I can't use the new colgate total. It has a horrid aftertaste that is the first thing i notice when i wake in the morning - still from the night before, and i realise i still notice it several times a day. I have given it a couple of months, but enough is enough.",1 stars
"Why, why, why?",2nd April 2019,"The ""New Formula"" is aweful. Been using Clean mint for as long as I can remember, we opened a new tube this past weekend and I'm here now complaining. It is terriable tasting and does not feel like my mouth is clean, kinda like a fake suger drink is in my mouth. Also the paste is kinda runny for a tooth paste. Seems odd that Colgate would release this trash upon us.",1 stars
Gagging new flavor,1st April 2019,"I have used Colgate advanced whitening for years. This ""new flavor"" is disgusting! My mouth is dry, I can't get rid of the taste even with mouthwash, and my teeth and mouth don't feel clean afterwards. I've read many of the same reviews and the response from the company, and no, it doesn't get better over time and I won't get used to it! It's an unpleasant experience that I don't want to ""get used to""! What bothers me the most is that they don't even give the consumer a choice to see whether or not it's something we want... just change it. I've given it time and I dislike it as much today as when I bought it a week ago so I guess it's time to change toothpastes.",1 stars
Previous flavor was great! Don't like the new flavor.,31st March 2019,"I just bought tube of the new flavor because I could not find tube of my favorite original paste TOTAL ADVANCE WHITENING. When tried the new flavor paste, I did not like it! Can't describe it, but it's a weird taste with hint of vanilla. Who's idea was it to change the flavor of the paste - and Why? Should have kept previous original paste! Could have added the new flavor to first test the market and monitor sales. Won't purchase ever again! I never liked the gel either. Please bring back previous flavor of paste! Thanks",1 stars
Bring back the old flavor!!!,29th March 2019,"Colgate changed the flavor of the advanced whitening and it is terrible! Please bring the old flavor back! The new flavor doesn't leave my mouth feeling clean after brushing my teeth, it's like I never even brushed them.",1 stars
notice a pattern? new flavor is really horrid!,29th March 2019,All the 4 star reviewers are part of a free sample program. Real users HATE the new taste. This new taste formula leaves such an awful pervasive taste in one's mouth. It ruins the flavor of any food or drink eaten after brushing. It cannot be rinsed away and lingers for a long time. Switching brands.,1 stars
"New ""Flavor"" Sucks... straight up flouride aftertaste all da",29th March 2019,"When going to the dentist, when 18 we were given the option to not use flouride. I can remember jumping for joy when I did not have to gag on that stuff! Now you have taken that bad memory and introduced it into a toothpaste that I have used religously for YEARS! Now I will have to stock up on the older tubes, or switch brands. The new flavor sucks!",1 stars
Ugh. Why a new flavor?,28th March 2019,Well dang. From reading everyone else's comments it seems that Colgate has no intentions of going back to the old flavor. I bought a five pack and will have to throw them all away. I can't handle the taste. Will have to find a new brand until if/when the flavor changes again.,1 stars
Horrible taste and no polishing effects,27th March 2019,"This new formula is the most horrible toothpaste I have ever used. When Total was first introduced, I switched exclusively to this toothpaste and have never purchased another brand. The new formula tastes very nasty, has an aftertaste that hangs around most of the day, doesn't have any of the ""grit"" that the old formula did to polish your teeth, and the first time you even try to eat or drink, your teeth feel fuzzy or dirty. Absolutely will not purchase again.",1 stars
I am dead inside,27th March 2019,"I am dead inside about this new formula. I'm sure it does all the things it claims to do, but I really don't like the flavor or consistency. My mouth has felt super dry since I started using it about two weeks ago, and I've never experienced that before. I don't understand why Colgate would force this new flavor on its customers. I literally only use Colgate toothpaste, and my dad is a dentist and always recommends it, but I think I will have to switch to some other brand now.",2 stars
"New Flavor, worst corporate decision ever.",24th March 2019,"I have been using Colgate since I can remember. I thought my family was playing a joke on me when I went to brush my teeth the other night. Well, it wasn't my family. Ha...Ha...Ha, jokes over, it's time to switch back to the old formula. Or you could stick it out for a while and see what happens. The Coke brothers failed at this in 1985 and now you are on track to be labeled as the ""Marketing blunder of the 21st century."" If this complaint doesn't change your mind, then I am confident that the stock markets reaction will.",1 stars
New Flavor,23rd March 2019,I've used Colgate toothpaste since I've been a child. I'm 70 now. My wife and I cannot use this product with the new flavor. I've cleaned out nearby stores of old product and don't know what we'll do after. It leaves an awful chalky taste after brushing.,1 stars
Done buying Colgate.,23rd March 2019,"This new ""flavor"" is disgusting. I've been using ONLY Colgate Total Whitening or Advanced Whitening since it came out, and Colgate my entire life. Mainly due to the flavor not making me gag every time I brushed my teeth. This new flavor and chalky texture makes me immediately need to gag. Why would you change the ENTIRE line? Couldn't you have left just one of the Whitening choices as the original!?!? I'm switching brands now, what a horrible decision by Colgate.",1 stars
I probably won't buy this product again,22nd March 2019,I have been buying Colgate Total Mint paste for years and have loved it...until now. The new clean mint flavor tastes horrible and leaves a bad coating on my tongue with an equally bad taste. I brush my tongue and it won't go away. I'm a very unhappy customer and I highly doubt I'll be this product again.,3 stars
I do not like the new toothpaste,22nd March 2019,"I have used Colgate total for years. I wasn't happy about the stannous fluoride because I know it tastes bad, but I gave it a shot. It tasted like I was brushing my teeth with sugar....compared ingredients with old tube, and sure enough, the new toothpaste has more artificial sweeteners. And I just saw a commercial of someone talking about sensitivity relief allowing them to continue to chew ice. Chewing ice is easily one of the worst preventable things you can do to your teeth, so good job Colgate on promoting a bad oral habit!",2 stars
New flavor is terrible!,22nd March 2019,"The new flavor is terrible! I have been using Colgate Total Advanced Whitening for many years and was very disappointed I tasted this new flavor. Please switch back to the old flavor. Meanwhile, I'll have to find other brand to get by.",1 stars
Hate the new flavor,21st March 2019,"I've been using this for years, but the new taste is so bad I'm now looking for a new brand.",1 stars
Probably not.,21st March 2019,"Add me to the list that does not like the ""new flavor"". My mouth dose not feel clean after using the ""new flavor. I may have to try Crest.",1 stars
New flavor is horrible,20th March 2019,The new flavor is in a box that doesn't even say it's new. Between my husband and I we have purchased 7 tubes trying to find the old flavor. You don't know it's a new flavor until you see the tube. It makes everything taste horrible for hours afterwards. And it doesn't even get my teeth clean. I've switched brands because every single box I find says SF and it's so bad. You should have left the older option instead of forcing the new formula on customers. You lost a loyal customer.,1 stars
Terrible new taste,20th March 2019,"I very rarely comment on reviews but I could not help myself. I didn't realize there was a new flavor until I started brushing my teeth tonight. Colgate has always been the only toothpaste I will use but this new TOTAL (SF) is terrible. It tastes like medicine and the taste sticks around for quite some time after brushing your teeth. I will not use this tooth paste again. As long as the whitening flavor does not change, I will remain a Colgate user. Colgate, please do not make this flavor a common one with your other options!",1 stars
I want my money back!,19th March 2019,"I would give zero stars if it was possible. My husband went to the store and bought a 2-pack of what he thought was our regular and beloved Colgate Total. We have used it for years ever since our dentist provided a sample to us. I had been a lifetime Crest user and switched because I loved it so much. I hate to tell you this, but ""new and improved flavors"" is false advertising. This is in no way whatsoever improved. I loved the clean mint paste flavor. This thin, gritty stuff tastes horrible! If I wanted a toothpaste for sensitive teeth, I would buy a different toothpaste. Why couldn't you keep it the way it was and make this in addition to the already great product you had? Then people who were looking for those other features could pick that and your loyal customers could still be happy. Now I am stuck with 2 tubes of this crud and have to spend even more money trying to find something new. If I knew this was going to happen, I would have purchased a year's supply of the good stuff. Very very disappointed.",1 stars
New Flavor Not Good,19th March 2019,"Colgate Clean Mint had been my favorite for years. This new flavor is so disappointing. I wish I could get a refund, but regardless will be switching to a new brand tomorrow. The new flavor isn't minty, doesn't feel clean and is generally unpleasant. I'm so bummed.",1 stars
Unsure of toothpaste,19th March 2019,I've bought every flavor of the new toothpaste but the taste of each is unpleasant to me. I've used Colgate for years but this new version of toothpaste needs to be updated. I've spent a lot of money buying each kind of the new toothpaste but have been disappointed thus far and it isn't cheap buying each flavor of each flavor of the new toothpaste. I feel as though I've thrown away a bunch of money. Please help make this right as I have provided my email for you to contact me.,2 stars
Taste terrible !! New and not good. Change back!!!!,18th March 2019,It tastes terrible! Please change back!!!! Please!,1 stars
Horrible new flavor,18th March 2019,"Purchased toothpaste this evening and the taste is horrible! It left a horrendous aftertaste also. It tastes very salty and does not leave my mouth feeling clean and fresh. I've never written a review before but I hope that these reviews will get noticed and the previous flavors will be offered again soon. It's so bad that I will have to switch brands until this new flavor is addressed. Sincerely, lifetime Colgate user.",1 stars
Terrible change in flavor,17th March 2019,I have been a longtime user of Colgate Total Advanced Whitening Paste and this new SF flavor is terrible. It leaves me with a dry mouth and bad aftertaste. We are disappointed that the flavor had to change!,1 stars
Gross flavor,17th March 2019,Been using Colgate for forever but this new flavor is so nasty. It's bad from the get go and then the aftertaste is even worse. I tried a few different tubes/varieties and they all taste bad. I'm going to have to switch brands.,1 stars
New flavor is horrible,17th March 2019,I have been a loyal Colgate user but unfortunately no more. The new flavor which you've changed across all your brands is horrible. Don't know why you had to change the taste. Please go back!!!,1 stars
Sad mouth,17th March 2019,"I was completely disappointed to see that all the stores around me had switched my beloved Colgate total clean mint to this new formulation. It tastes sweet and my mouth does not feel as clean when using it. I'm an avid brusher, at least 2-3 times a day, but have found I'm brushing my teeth 3-4xs more trying to rid my mouth of its taste. Please bring back the original formula, you guys already have sensitive formulas, not everyone wants a sensitive toothpaste.",1 stars
Flavor change is not good,16th March 2019,I've been using this forever but don't like the new flavor at all.,1 stars
TERRIBLE NEW FLAVOR,16th March 2019,This new flavor is horrendous. So bad this is the first time in my life I've gotten on a website to leave a negative review. I've switched toothpastes and won't be going back unless the old flavor is offered. Normally I would just deal with the bad flavor but this literally makes me sick. So disappointed.,1 stars
New Flavor is Awful,13th March 2019,I have used Colgate Total for years and the new flavor is gross I can't get the taste out of my mouth. Please for the love of God bring back the old flavor.,1 stars
New Active Ingredient=Terrible,9th March 2019,"I have always used the Colgate Total Clean Mint Paste.....Until you changed the taste and added the new active ingredient. Please bring back the old formula this was the only toothpaste our family liked. The new toothpaste leaves a terrible taste in in your mouth and does not feel as clean as the the old one. Now we are searching for a new brand. Not good, have you ever heard the old saying if it's not broke don't fix it!!!!",1 stars
The new flavor is terrible. Unrefreshing.,7th March 2019,The new flavor is awful. Please bring old clean mint formula back. My mouth does not feel clean after new formula.,1 stars
Bring back original formula,5th March 2019,I have used Colgate Total for years since it was recommended to me by a dental hygienist. I quickly grabbed a tube the other day at the store and to my surprise the formula now contains stannous flouride which is known to stain teeth. I have enough trouble keeping my teeth white without using teeth staining toothpaste. Please bring back the original formula.,1 stars
"Dislike the ""new flavor""",4th March 2019,"Please go back to original clean mint formula. This new formula leaves a bad aftertaste, not even minty. I doubt I'll be using this toothpaste much longer.",1 stars
Yuck!,2nd March 2019,I really dislike the new flavor - there was nothing wrong with the old flavor. Please tell me where I can purchase the original flavor formula.,1 stars
"hate it, wish they would put it back the way it used to be",1st March 2019,"This is horrible. It was great before the new formula, now I won't use this brand anymore. AWFUL. I hate medicinal ingredients, they are not necessary nor wanted. We want a gentle tooth paste not one for sensitivity of teeth - (again/hate medicinal). Tastes medicinal or metalic and aftertaste too, can't stand it. mouth keeps making more saliva than before using it, something's wrong with this new paste. Paste way runny too. Feels burning too on lips. If you claim triclosan was safe before, you should have stuck to it, and kept it how it was. Used it for years- fed up with how companies always feel the need to ruin a good thing and add unneeded ingredients. Now I have to go find something else and that's hard when sensitive to everything out there :( wish I could wash this toothpastes taste out of my mouth right now -_-",1 stars
Switching Brands,25th February 2019,"Was there some sort of nationwide groundswell for you all to make a change in the original formula of Colgate Total Toothpaste? If there was I didn't hear of it. No, there wasn't was there? This was done just for the sake of change I suspect. Because, ""we just needed to do something"". That's what this feels like, anyway. Reminds me of the same blunder of the New Coke decision. No, after over 35 years as my toothpaste of choice, I'm leaving. I can't stand this new formula. First thing I noticed was the odd ""foaming"" during brushing. Like it never really gets going to do its job like the original formula. And the aftertaste? Ugh. It lingers unpleasantly in my mouth for over an hour or more. This odd metallic taste. Why did you do this?? I always loved the clean bright taste after brushing! Now? I'm outta here. There are plenty of options nowadays. Sorry, but this ""New Flavor"" is awful.",1 stars
Do Not like the New Flavor,23rd February 2019,I dont not like the taste of the new flavor. My teeth dont feel clean. I am not left with a minty refreshing feeling in my mouth.,1 stars
"Terrible New Flavor - Lifelong Colgate User, Disappointed!",22nd February 2019,"I've never used Crest, I've never used Tom's, only Colgate, my entire life. I'm so sad to say this new formula not only feels horrible in my mouth, but tastes absolutely terrible. I can't say I've ever been offended by a toothpaste flavor, seems like such a silly thing, but I was compelled enough to write this review! The old formula was frothy and minty and left my mouth feeling fresh. This version is flat, runny and leaves my mouth with a chemical aftertaste that isn't what I would describe as minty at all. I can't believe it, but I guess it's time to seek another brand after 42 years!",1 stars
Stains teeth with new stannous flouride,20th February 2019,Bought this product not knowing it had stannous flouride in it. Used it for 3 weeks and my teeth turned very yellow.,1 stars
This stuff is garbage,19th February 2019,"PLEASE BRING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULA. The stannous fluoride does absolutely NOTHING for my teeth and I've had to go back to the regular Colgate Total. I realize some people may not approve of the Triclosan, but that stuff has ALWAYS worked for me and has left my teeth feeling squeaky clean along with super fresh breath. If you have tried other toothpastes with stannous fluoride and they didn't work for you, trust me this isn't any better. I am truly disappointed because I love Colgate but am going to have to discontinue using their toothpastes if they don't bring back the original formula. Thank you for reading this.",1 stars
Excellent Toothpaste,17th February 2019,"I am a long time user of Colgate Total Toothpaste. This new formula is just as good if not better. It leaves the entire mouth feeling extremely clean for a long time and provides all of the described benefits including clean, healthy teeth, cavity protection, and whitening. I will definitely be using this toothpaste.",5 stars
Sodium Laurel Sulphate,16th February 2019,Unfortunately this toothpaste contains Sodium Laurel Sulphate which can cause mouth ulcers. For me it is the worst thing I could put in my mouth on a toothbrush. Please consider making a toothpaste with out it please.,1 stars
New favor is gross!! Bring back the old one!,15th February 2019,I've used Colgate total advanced whitening for years and then all of a sudden they changed the favor of it and it's disgusting now. Also the tube is smaller than the last one. What does the 'SF' even mean?,1 stars
Hate the new flavor!,12th February 2019,"Have used Colgate total for years. However, now that they have changed the flavor I will be looking for a new toothpaste! Used leave me with a minty taste and now it's just off!",2 stars

Colgate Total SF,3rd February 2019,This is a good toothpaste for people with sensitive teeth who want a little whitening and cavity protection. I didn't feel that the taste was minty enough to leave my breath feeling fresh but overall a good choice as an everyday toothpaste.,4 stars

Great to have a TOTAL toothpaste,30th January 2019,"I like the idea of having a ""Total"" toothpaste. The texture is softer than the Colgate Great Regular Flavor that I have used ALL my life, leaving my bathroom sink a little messier if it's left on the brush too long.",4 stars

Pleasant taste,30th January 2019,Good consistency. Pleasant taste.,5 stars
Works great,30th January 2019,"Colgate Total SF Toothpaste Clean Mint was a pleasant surprise. I was not aware of this version of Colgate toothpaste prior to now. First, I thought it would be a gel, which I find too strong-tasting, but it's a paste. The flavor was light, which fits my expectation in a toothpaste. I have included two pictures: one before I started using the product and one two weeks later. Both are before brushing and I am amazed at the whitening of my teeth. I have been a long time Colgate user and will continue with this product.",5 stars

I pay very close attention to my teeth before and after (my mom is in the dental field and has made me very conscious of my teeth) and can see the difference right away of what the toothpaste is able to get off. I also use the Colgate 360 brush and floss, (remember brushing is no substitute for flossing) but this toothpaste gets the job done every time and especially helps with cavities. (I've been cavity free for the last 5+ years!)",5 stars

Colgate total SF leaves your mouth feeling clean even though it hasn't a strong mint taste.I would recommend the Colgate Total SF Toothpaste Clean Mint to people that are sensitive and doesn't like a powerful mint flavor.

A nice surprise,19th January 2019,I have sensitive teeth so finding a toothpaste that freshens and whiten along with protecting against sensitivity made me thrilled,5 stars
Stannous is the key,19th January 2019,"I was a little nervous about using this product as its ingredients were quite different from the regular Colgate Total that I usually use. This toothpaste is thinner (has a lower viscosity). I prefer a thicker, more viscous toothpaste because that makes me feel as if I am getting more toothpaste and cleaning power on my teeth. Without considering the benefits of stannous fluoride, I would definitely stick with my regular Total. However, if I feel that I need to use a safer antibacterial agent than the triclosan that is in my regular Total, then I would brush with the Total SF. In summation, it really comes down to which antibacterial agent you prefer to have in your toothpaste, Triclosan or Stannous Fluoride. The jury is still out on that one. It may be nice to have both in your oral care arsenal so that you don't overuse one or the other. One last note: the emphasis in the name should be on its antibacterial properties and not on whitening. Calling it ""Advanced Whitening"" puts the most emphasis on an aspect which, at best, appears to be equal to all the other aspects of the toothpaste.",4 stars
I would buy this again,17th January 2019,This is a great product to use daily. No harsh taste and leaves your mouth feeling clean ad fresh,5 stars

Chemical AfterTtaste,15th January 2019,"This version of Colgate Total provided great cleaning power, however, the strong medical taste reminded me of the numbing agent dentists use before injecting Novocain.

I would not buy this product,15th January 2019,"Not sure if Total toothpaste is a good alternative for Golgate's Optic White toothpaste.

Colgate Total Original Tootpaste,7th January 2019,"I've been using Colgate Total Original toothpaste for a few weeks now and although I have found the minty flavour pleasant and that it cleans well and leaves my mouth feeling fresh, I probably wouldn't change from my usual toothpaste. I found it didn't 'foam up' as easily and used more product to achieve that extra clean feeling. I didn't notice any increased benefit from the 'Total' claim either. So although a pleasant good toothpaste I wouldn't say it was worth the extra pennies and for myself didn't stand up to the claims.",3 stars

Total and prolonged freshness,2nd January 2019,"Colgate Total Original makes me feel that my teeth and gums are thoroughly cleaned and leaves me feeling fresh for the whole day. I do love the toothpaste taste and consistency, and all my family enjoys this product. I find it really good value for money if you care about getting your oral hygene to the next level. The quality of the toothpaste is great and a little amount goes a long way, so it will last longer than other brands. The only downside I found, was that the toothpaste does not address my sensitivity issue, but on the other side it does not claim to be specifically for that either. I recommend Colgate Total Original as it's a great product for the whole family.",4 stars

Would definitely purchase again.,29th December 2018,"Whilst I found that Colgate Total Original did not address my sensitivity issues as well as another toothpaste by the same brand I did feel that my teeth and gums were thoroughly cleaned and left feeling fresh and cared for to a high standard. Other members of my household also trialled this product and were 100% happy with it from the standard of cleaning, freshness and care to value for money as using the recommended amount was more than sufficient meaning that it lasted longer than other brands. Apart from the sensitivity issue I feel that Colgate Total Original far surpasses other brands and I will certainly be purchasing this again for the rest of my family.",5 stars

Great value good oral health for all,24th December 2018,"I've tried many different brands and types of toothpaste over the years, and this Colgate Total Original Toothpaste is up with the best of them. Out of the toothpastes I rate highest, this is one of the only ones that does not come with a premium price. The slightly boring packaging hides a great toothpaste that keeps your mouth feeling fresh and clean, long after brushing. The minty flavour is pleasant and not too strong. Alongside this the texture of the toothpaste being slightly thicker than others I've tried, makes it feel like it is really working during brushing. My husband, who can be a bit picky over toothpastes, also really liked it. Overall it is a great toothpaste which is value for money, and will keep the whole family's mouths to be, feel and look healthy.",4 stars

Colgate Total - a new Original?,19th December 2018,"Our family has been using Colgate toothpaste for a long while - before my husband and I got together and then ever since. We've used Colgate Total Original Care ever since it was launched. We like the texture, the taste and the resultant mouth feel after brushing. The toothpaste works well. The children do not use it because of the strong minty taste as they are sensitive to strong tastes. The new Original is different from our usual one because of the texture - it is drier and also dries out the mouth more after brushing; the taste - the mint seems to be a different variety - stronger and more intense in taste and the general mouth feel is also a bit different. These differences indicate a formulation change. We will continue to use Colgate Total.",5 stars

Fresh and Minty,18th December 2018,Colgate Total Original Toothpate is exactly what you would expect from Colgate. It has a very nice strong minty flavour and leaves your mouth feeling very fresh and clean. The only down side to it for me is the texture. Being a paste it feels quite thick and gummy in your mouth when you first start brushing. Once you get past that part though it's a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good minty toothpaste.,4 stars

The best toothpaste I have ever used,31st May 2017,"Initially it has no taste, but after brushing for a little while it has a pleasant minty taste.

Probably the best toothpaste I have ever used. However, I am concerned whether the abrasive effect could damage the tooth enamel if it is used on a full -time basis and whether it possibly should be used in conjunction with another toothpaste.",5 stars

Contents good continer poor,11th January 2016,"I have used Colgate for many years without a problem. However the last two tubes I have used, 125ml, have burst along the silver seal at the side. I have never had this happen over the years & I am not using the tube in a different way.

Leaves teeth feeling so smooth,4th August 2013,"Loved using the advanced clean product. Pros: The texture I noticed wasn't gritty like a lot of toothpastes are. My mouth felt so clean after brushing. Couldn't stop running y tongue against my teeth! Great for lasting fresh breath. Good values for money. A little goes a long way. The only downside to this is the powerful flavour, bit too minty for my taste, however some probably like this in a toothpaste! All in all, great product, highly recommended, thanks.",4 stars

"Tastes good, feels good and does your teeth good",17th June 2013,I have used Colgate toothpastes for a few years now after tasting several makes and finding that some of the other leading brands just turned me off completely. Several of the Colgate brands taste good and certainly seem to clean my teeth well.I use an electric toothbrush and that and the use of Colgate has meant that I have not had to have a filling in years which is a bonus as a long time ago every visit to the dentist meant another filling to the point that several of my teeth are more mercury amalgum or capped than actual tooth.It's a pity that electric toothbrushes and modern toothpastes were not around then as I would have less fear of breaking a delicate tooth than I have today.,5 stars

Interdental Entertainment,17th June 2013,"The Interdental toothpaste means eating out and eating anything is a joy and entertaining thanks to the unique way it cleans in between the teeth and gums.

"Tastes good, feels good and does your teeth good",17th June 2013,I have used Colgate toothpastes for a few years now after tasting several makes and finding that some of the other leading brands just turned me off completely. Several of the Colgate brands taste good and certainly seem to clean my teeth well.I use an electric toothbrush and that and the use of Colgate has meant that I have not had to have a filling in years which is a bonus as a long time ago every visit to the dentist meant another filling to the point that several of my teeth are more mercury amalgum or capped than actual tooth.It's a pity that electric toothbrushes and modern toothpastes were not around then as I would have less fear of breaking a delicate tooth than I have today.,5 stars
Does what it says on the tube,17th June 2013,I have been using Colgate Total for over 3 years now and I have found that they have improved the health of my teeth immensely. My teeth are now whiter and brighter and I have not had to have any dental work done for 4 years now! My dentist said my teeth look very healthy - Thank you so much Colgate.,5 stars

Review of Colgate Total Advanced Whitening Toothpaste,16th June 2013,"I have been using this product for the last 4 weeks & am very pleased with the fresh taste that it leaves in the mouth after brushing. It also has a nice minty taste that is not overpowering, unlike other toothpastes that I have used before. Unfortunately, I have not found the whitening effect to be as good as I would have expected as this is the main feature of this particular product. I will of course continue to use the product until the tube is empty & hope that I will notice more of an improvement with the extended use. Overall, it is a really nice product that I am happy to use on a regular basis & will almost certainly use regularly from now on.

Sooooo Clean,13th June 2013,I didn't know what to expect from this toothpaste but boy was i impressed. I started brushing and thought it is very like any other toothpaste. I rinsed my brush and then the magic happened. As I continued to clean the product literally filled my mouth with a gentle foam cleaning everywhere just like a pleasant mouthwash. I was surprised how much my teeth felt clean - better than my previous toothpaste and I thought that was good. I was also pleased with how white my teeth were even after one use. Overall this is probably the best toothpaste I have ever used. Absolutely love it.,5 stars

one of the best product from colgate,13th June 2013,"i would definitely recommrnd this product to anyone, since I have been using Colgate from I was an infant...i have never experienced such a clean fresh feel for a very long time after using it.... Colgate Interdental is a winner",5 stars

Unbeatable results!,13th June 2013,"As a smoker and constant drinker of coffee, I am very conscious of the effect these have on my teeth. I am constantly looking for products which are reasonably priced in order to keep my teeth white. I was slightly sceptical to the claims made by Colgate with this product, however I was more than pleasantly surprised. The toothpaste is pleasantly flavoured, not too strong or weak and left my mouth feeling clean and refreshed. The best bit though is how it manages to clean in between the teeth so effectively. The difference can be seen after only a few days of using. I would definately recommend this to anyone and everyone. Well done Colgate!",5 stars

Deep Clean Feeling,13th June 2013,"After trying Colgate Interdental for a few weeks I was very impressed with the results, after brushing my teeth felt really clean almost like they do after having them cleaned at the dentist.

Overall the clean feeling is very impressive.",4 stars
Total Interdental,13th June 2013,"I enjoyed using the product. Although it left my mouth feeling clean, I expected my mouth to feel a lot cleaner than it did.

"Fantastic Interdental tooth ""scrub""",13th June 2013,"I loved this product because I have a back bar after having braces on my teeth so this toothpaste really helps get into the grooves and give my teeth a really good clean almost like a scrub!

I would recommend this product as my teeth felt like they've had a professional clean, and my breath was fresh!",5 stars
Mint taste - white smile,13th June 2013,The taste in the paste is very minty but the texture is almost scaley. It's a little harsh around the gums but all in all the sense of cleanliness afterwards is awesome. You get the feeling that with prolonged usage the smile will become whiter and that there will be plenty of benefits of using this in the future,4 stars

Colgateจ Totalจ Interdental Toothpaste: The Review,12th June 2013,"When 1st opening the tube to reveal it's contents you're looking at the paste thinking what on earth is that. It's like no toothpaste I had ever seen before. The texture is quite bizarre, it's a lot thicker than most toothpastes with a strange look to it too. When you 1st put it on your teeth it feels like there are tiny grains of some strange substance (I can only imagine it's for it's abrasive qualities) that feels very unusual to the feel and taste. Once these 'grains' have dissolved however it becomes like your general tooth paste and the strange feeling dissipates. This isn't a slight on the product at all, on the contrary i think it works very well and i can imagine this is the route toothpastes are going to take in the future rather that your bog standard white paste that flows from your usual tube. It leaves lasting freshness for a good time after which is all you can ask from a toothpaste. A thumbs up from me, plus i have already bought a tube so myself and my family are continuing to use it.",4 stars

Interdental toothpaste,12th June 2013,It was actually nicer than I expected. When I opened it I was a little put off because it didn't look like normal toothpaste. The micro particles scrub the hard to reach areas. It's not very minty which was the only downside for me.,4 stars

I have been using Colgate Total for some time and that is an excellent product - even my 7 year old grandson likes the taste. However, Colgateจ Totalจ Interdental Toothpaste is a revelation, it does what it says on the packet - and more. No more furry teeth, bad breath and a lovely 'just left the dentist feel'. Any my grandson stole my little tube!",5 stars

I would definitely recommend you try this.,12th June 2013,"i was a bit sceptical at first about the claims this toothpaste made but, I was pleasantly surprised. I have a little staining in between a couple of my top teeth and I have noticed a difference after using the toothpaste for only a couple of days. I hope that prolonged use will make a more marked difference. The clean feel lasts for hours, even after eating other meals. the texture of the toothpaste is very slightly grainy but I think that will be to do with the bicarb. I can live with it though, the results are worth it. I would definitely recommend this product.",4 stars

Colgate® Total® Interdental Toothpaste: The Review,12th June 2013,"When 1st opening the tube to reveal it's contents you're looking at the paste thinking what on earth is that. It's like no toothpaste I had ever seen before. The texture is quite bizarre, it's a lot thicker than most toothpastes with a strange look to it too. When you 1st put it on your teeth it feels like there are tiny grains of some strange substance (I can only imagine it's for it's abrasive qualities) that feels very unusual to the feel and taste. Once these 'grains' have dissolved however it becomes like your general tooth paste and the strange feeling dissipates. This isn't a slight on the product at all, on the contrary i think it works very well and i can imagine this is the route toothpastes are going to take in the future rather that your bog standard white paste that flows from your usual tube. It leaves lasting freshness for a good time after which is all you can ask from a toothpaste. A thumbs up from me, plus i have already bought a tube so myself and my family are continuing to use it.",4 stars

Fair toothpaste,12th June 2013,The taste / flavour of the toothpaste was average and the after taste was not as memorable as I was expecting. The level of the interdental activity is difficult to gauge without equipment that can examine the interdental spaces.,3 stars

Colgate interdental,12th June 2013,"This product is brilliant, within a week my teeth looked much whiter and good. I noticed the difference after the first use, my mouth felt clean and my teeth felt smooth and shiny. I felt my mouth felt generally better and noticed how good it felt. I have actually bought some of this toothpaste for my Brother and his Wife and my nephew and niece who are both married. All the family were surprised particularly my brother who has never changed his toothpaste. You have 4 new buyers from me buying it for them. I consider it was worth the cost as the toothpaste is so good. The toothpaste has brilliant features which I have never found in any other toothpaste. All my family are now totally sold on Colgate interdental and I am so pleased i did. Thank you to the researchers of Colgate interdental toothpaste you have a winner with this product.",5 stars

Very different to others I have used,12th June 2013,"The first thing I noticed about this toothpaste is its opaque colour, hen you get it into your mouth the minty taste is very nice but the texture is gritty and the taste turns strangely soapy. It does leave your teeth feeling really clean and the aftertaste is refreshing and minty. Overall I do like this product.",4 stars

Brighter result,8th June 2013,"I've always admired the ""Hollywood smile"" but my teeth were the complete opposite! In my teens I was lucky to get orthodontic treatment and I am so glad that I did the pain and years were worth it! Although when my braces were taken out my teeth were slightly off white. So over the years I've been experimenting with different whitening toothpastes which all the range from different sizes and price. However I was not finding dramatic results they only made a slight difference. A family member introduced me to Colgate Total Advanced Whitening and after days of using it I saw results. My teeth look healthier and I feel better about myself. I feel more confident and I can't help but smile. :)",5 stars
