"Amazing results!!!,11th August 2021,""I used to have a lot of Black Plaque on my teeth, no matter what toothbrush I used to use nothing would take it off. My teeth were also yellowish in colour. I was very embarrassed to smile, I was not confident in my smile at all. I was also so embarrassed going to the dentist. My dentist tried to remove it but was unsuccessful. I was told by the dentist that my black plaque on my top back tooth would never be removed no matter how much I brush my teeth. So I gave up looking for the best toothbrush to remove my plaque. But one day I heard about the oral B pro 3 electric toothbrush and decided to buy it and give it a chance. After using it for a few days I was mind blown when I saw the result of my teeth. I noticed some of the plaque had come off. And after a week my plaque was completed remove and my teeth were much more whiter than they were before using the electric toothbrush. I would not choose or consider any other toothbrush as this toothbrush was absolutely amazing. Not only was I now confident in my smile but the electric toothbrush did things that the dentist could not do. I could not recommend this product enough. I would highly suggest you to try this out. It is an absolute game changer. I could not be more happy. Thank you so much oral b you have really change my life and my smile."",5 stars"

"Amazing results!!!,11th August 2021,""I used to have a lot of Black Plaque on my teeth, no matter what toothbrush I used to use nothing would take it off. My teeth were also yellowish in colour. I was very embarrassed to smile, I was not confident in my smile at all. I was also so embarrassed going to the dentist. My dentist tried to remove it but was unsuccessful. I was told by the dentist that my black plaque on my top back tooth would never be removed no matter how much I brush my teeth. So I gave up looking for the best toothbrush to remove my plaque. But one day I heard about the oral B pro 3 electric toothbrush and decided to buy it and give it a chance. After using it for a few days I was mind blown when I saw the result of my teeth. I noticed some of the plaque had come off. And after a week my plaque was completed remove and my teeth were much more whiter than they were before using the electric toothbrush. I would not choose or consider any other toothbrush as this toothbrush was absolutely amazing. Not only was I now confident in my smile but the electric toothbrush did things that the dentist could not do. I could not recommend this product enough. I would highly suggest you to try this out. It is an absolute game changer. I could not be more happy. Thank you so much oral b you have really change my life and my smile."",5 stars"

"Amazing results!!!,11th August 2021,""I used to have a lot of Black Plaque on my teeth, no matter what toothbrush I used to use nothing would take it off. My teeth were also yellowish in colour. I was very embarrassed to smile, I was not confident in my smile at all. I was also so embarrassed going to the dentist. My dentist tried to remove it but was unsuccessful. I was told by the dentist that my black plaque on my top back tooth would never be removed no matter how much I brush my teeth. So I gave up looking for the best toothbrush to remove my plaque. But one day I heard about the oral B pro 3 electric toothbrush and decided to buy it and give it a chance. After using it for a few days I was mind blown when I saw the result of my teeth. I noticed some of the plaque had come off. And after a week my plaque was completed remove and my teeth were much more whiter than they were before using the electric toothbrush. I would not choose or consider any other toothbrush as this toothbrush was absolutely amazing. Not only was I now confident in my smile but the electric toothbrush did things that the dentist could not do. I could not recommend this product enough. I would highly suggest you to try this out. It is an absolute game changer. I could not be more happy. Thank you so much oral b you have really change my life and my smile."",5 stars"

"Amazing results!!!,11th August 2021,""I used to have a lot of Black Plaque on my teeth, no matter what toothbrush I used to use nothing would take it off. My teeth were also yellowish in colour. I was very embarrassed to smile, I was not confident in my smile at all. I was also so embarrassed going to the dentist. My dentist tried to remove it but was unsuccessful. I was told by the dentist that my black plaque on my top back tooth would never be removed no matter how much I brush my teeth. So I gave up looking for the best toothbrush to remove my plaque. But one day I heard about the oral B pro 3 electric toothbrush and decided to buy it and give it a chance. After using it for a few days I was mind blown when I saw the result of my teeth. I noticed some of the plaque had come off. And after a week my plaque was completed remove and my teeth were much more whiter than they were before using the electric toothbrush. I would not choose or consider any other toothbrush as this toothbrush was absolutely amazing. Not only was I now confident in my smile but the electric toothbrush did things that the dentist could not do. I could not recommend this product enough. I would highly suggest you to try this out. It is an absolute game changer. I could not be more happy. Thank you so much oral b you have really change my life and my smile."",5 stars"

"Amazing results!!!,11th August 2021,""I used to have a lot of Black Plaque on my teeth, no matter what toothbrush I used to use nothing would take it off. My teeth were also yellowish in colour. I was very embarrassed to smile, I was not confident in my smile at all. I was also so embarrassed going to the dentist. My dentist tried to remove it but was unsuccessful. I was told by the dentist that my black plaque on my top back tooth would never be removed no matter how much I brush my teeth. So I gave up looking for the best toothbrush to remove my plaque. But one day I heard about the oral B pro 3 electric toothbrush and decided to buy it and give it a chance. After using it for a few days I was mind blown when I saw the result of my teeth. I noticed some of the plaque had come off. And after a week my plaque was completed remove and my teeth were much more whiter than they were before using the electric toothbrush. I would not choose or consider any other toothbrush as this toothbrush was absolutely amazing. Not only was I now confident in my smile but the electric toothbrush did things that the dentist could not do. I could not recommend this product enough. I would highly suggest you to try this out. It is an absolute game changer. I could not be more happy. Thank you so much oral b you have really change my life and my smile."",5 stars"

Great buy,8th August 2021,Oral b is one of the best toothbrushes on the market today and this one is ideal too as if u r going away u have a carry case.

"Amazing results!!!,11th August 2021,""I used to have a lot of Black Plaque on my teeth, no matter what toothbrush I used to use nothing would take it off. My teeth were also yellowish in colour. I was very embarrassed to smile, I was not confident in my smile at all. I was also so embarrassed going to the dentist. My dentist tried to remove it but was unsuccessful. I was told by the dentist that my black plaque on my top back tooth would never be removed no matter how much I brush my teeth. So I gave up looking for the best toothbrush to remove my plaque. But one day I heard about the oral B pro 3 electric toothbrush and decided to buy it and give it a chance. After using it for a few days I was mind blown when I saw the result of my teeth. I noticed some of the plaque had come off. And after a week my plaque was completed remove and my teeth were much more whiter than they were before using the electric toothbrush. I would not choose or consider any other toothbrush as this toothbrush was absolutely amazing. Not only was I now confident in my smile but the electric toothbrush did things that the dentist could not do. I could not recommend this product enough. I would highly suggest you to try this out. It is an absolute game changer. I could not be more happy. Thank you so much oral b you have really change my life and my smile."",5 stars"

"Amazing results!!!,11th August 2021,""I used to have a lot of Black Plaque on my teeth, no matter what toothbrush I used to use nothing would take it off. My teeth were also yellowish in colour. I was very embarrassed to smile, I was not confident in my smile at all. I was also so embarrassed going to the dentist. My dentist tried to remove it but was unsuccessful. I was told by the dentist that my black plaque on my top back tooth would never be removed no matter how much I brush my teeth. So I gave up looking for the best toothbrush to remove my plaque. But one day I heard about the oral B pro 3 electric toothbrush and decided to buy it and give it a chance. After using it for a few days I was mind blown when I saw the result of my teeth. I noticed some of the plaque had come off. And after a week my plaque was completed remove and my teeth were much more whiter than they were before using the electric toothbrush. I would not choose or consider any other toothbrush as this toothbrush was absolutely amazing. Not only was I now confident in my smile but the electric toothbrush did things that the dentist could not do. I could not recommend this product enough. I would highly suggest you to try this out. It is an absolute game changer. I could not be more happy. Thank you so much oral b you have really change my life and my smile."",5 stars"

Fantastic battery life,9th August 2021,This was bought at Christmas to replace my basic electric toothbrush. The battery life is stupendous. In the 7 months I've had it it has had to be charged only a handful of times. The 2 speeds work well making sure my mouth is fresh and clean and the pressure warning light is a bonus. The carry case is essential to take on holiday rather than leaving it behind and taking a manual. I'd definitely recommend this brush buy it!,5 stars

Very efficient,9th August 2021,I bought this to replace a rather elderly Oral B which was running very slowly. What a difference! A choice of speeds but all fast and efficient leaving my teeth feeling very clean. The battery stays charged for ages. The travel case is very handy. Stops your toothbrush from accidentally being turned on and vibrating in your luggage. Most embarrassing! So glad I upgraded to this.,5 stars
I'm using oral b...,9th August 2021,I'm using oral b electric toothbrush more than 10 years and what can I say I'm obsessed with this brand.

Great buy,8th August 2021,Oral b is one of the best toothbrushes on the market today and this one is ideal too as if u r going away u have a carry case. I am disabled and having a oral b toothbrush makes it so much easier to brush with ease.

I tend to save up when I know mine needs replacing like now,5 stars
